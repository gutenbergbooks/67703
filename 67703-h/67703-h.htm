<small>A DWELLER IN DARKNESS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE light on the Clock Tower, that cheerful beacon
which assures Britons that good and picked men
are kept from their beds to raise the standard of their
liberties, and, incidentally, their taxes, had just gone out,
sharply, as though glad to announce to yet-stirring London
a respite from the babble of lawmaking; and the
great workshop of Westminster where the artisans are
so many and busy, and the results perhaps so meagre,
discharged its crowd into the illuminated night. Out
they came hurrying, for the hour was late: the sitting
had been animated and prolonged, and even professional,
to say nothing of casual, politicians are nowadays too
busy in wasting the nation&#8217;s time not to set a high value
on their own. Out they streamed, still chattering and
arguing, as became the priests in that great Temple of
the Tongue, those of them whose voices were seldom
heard and never listened to in the House talking the
loudest outside; a varied crew typifying the component
parts of their country&#8217;s greatness. Ministers, bent, fine-drawn
and unkempt, as men whose ceaseless rolling of
Sisyphian stones gave no time to spare for the clothes-brush,
superior Under-Secretaries, some dapper, others<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
affecting a soul and a mission above the niceties of
costume, all far more important than any Prime Minister
who ever lived, and displaying a pretty contempt
for those of the rank and file who took upon themselves
to criticise the conduct of the debate; then the mob
of hungry politicians, keen hustlers; here sharp-faced
wood-cutters in the tangled forests of the Law, each
with his axe to grind; there egotistical, opulent tradesmen,
members by virtue of contributions to the Party
coffers, and with a never-sleeping eye on the Birthday
Honours list; now smart men of leisure gained by their
fathers&#8217; toil, merely adding the House of Commons to
their clubs; and so on, with here and there a single-minded
politician who imagined, misguided man, that
he served his country by supporting his own shade of
opinion, seeking nothing for himself, and getting nothing&mdash;but
influenza and the privilege of leaving to his
party the legacy of an inconvenient bye-election.</p>

<p>&#8220;Capital speech of yours, Herriard. Won&#8217;t do you
any harm.&#8221; The speaker was a genial, middle-aged
man of fashion who liked to be in the House as he liked
to have the <i>entr&eacute;e</i> everywhere, and to stand well with
everybody from the Premier to the latest blatant labour
member.</p>

<p>&#8220;Glad you liked it, Sir Henry. I was rather afraid
I should be squeezed out after Darrell&#8217;s interminable
effort,&#8221; answered Herriard, as he swung himself into a
hansom. &#8220;Can I give you a lift?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks. No. My man ought to be here. Many
congratulations. Good-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Herriard nodded and leaned back. &#8220;Park Lane,&#8221; he
called out to the driver. As the cab turned out of the
courtyard the more brilliant lights of Great George<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
Street fell upon the face within it, that of a young man,
interesting enough, handsome and not without character,
which latter trait was perhaps just then more
strongly accentuated than usual by the illuminating expression
of the hour&#8217;s success. It was a face more interesting
by its suggestion of possibilities than by any
marked indication of actual, present power.</p>

<p>A short distance up Park Lane Herriard dismissed
the cab and walked on. On his left, under a crescent
moon, the Park lay slumbering still, and, save for a
few nocturnal prowlers, lifeless: in vivid contrast to the
still busy, if languid, roll of traffic on the other side of
its railings. Herriard, walking briskly, turned up Hertford
Street, and presently taking a little used thoroughfare,
made his way deep into the intricacies of Mayfair,
that curious maze of mansions and slums where Peers
live next door to slop-shops, and the chorus from a
footman&#8217;s Free-and-Easy at the public-house across the
street may keep awake a dowager countess or weave
melody into ducal dreams.</p>

<p>At the end of an out-of-the-way spur from what was
half street, half mews, Herriard stopped before the old-fashioned
portico of a house the frontage of which, at
any rate, was squeezed up in a corner, giving at the
same time a suggestion of greater expansion at the back.
A curious eighteenth century residence, built on unconventional
and, with regard to space, ingeniously utilitarian
lines; a house that nineteen out of twenty passers-by
would fail to notice and the twentieth would stop
to wonder at, since the genuinely quaint has of late
years in London given way to the hideously regular or
the pretentiously unconventional. As he reached the
projecting doorway, Herriard turned sharply and glanced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
back down the short street. He was alone there; obviously
no one without special business would be likely
to pass that way. Then he took out a latch-key and
let himself in, passed through an octagon hall hung with
rare tapestry, went up a broad staircase so heavily carpeted
that no footfall could be heard, gave a slight
knock at one of the doors on the square landing, and
went in.</p>

<p>If the hall and stairway were marvels of costly decoration,
the room Herriard had entered was, particularly
in contrast to the house&#8217;s dingy exterior, a still
greater revelation, and, in its bearing upon the character
of the inmate, should have a short word of description.
The walls were hung with dark crimson silk of which,
however, little could be seen between the exquisitely
toned frames of the multitudes of striking pictures,
mostly or all of the French school, with which it was
covered. But the whole tone and furniture of the room
were French, and French at its most ingenious and its
quaintest. The eye fed on a mass of art, simple and
applied, never flamboyant, and subdued with such skill
and taste that the sense of crowding and profusion was
kept from obtruding itself. Everything was novel, unexpected,
and yet logically fitted to its place, and the
general toning-down effect was aided by the many
exquisite bronzes which were placed with an artistic
eye about the room. To make an end, the ceiling was
a radiant specimen of Angelica Kaufmann&#8217;s brush-work,
showing so little age that the newer glories below could
not kill it, and the floor was covered with a rare Aubusson
of a design that invited and yet defied analysis.</p>

<p>Projecting from one side of the room was a singular
piece of furniture, half bed, half sofa, with a fantastic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
canopy arranged on carved supports, and with a coverlet
of the finest silk. On this couch lay a man. The
face that, with the exception of a long thin hand resting
on the silken coverlet, was all that could be seen
of him, showed a man of singular power and character.
The impression which this vivid personality gave might
be summed up in one word, concentration: intense concentration
physical as well as mental. The dark eyes
seemed to scintillate as under the high pressure of a
fully charged brain. The black hair was clinched close
to the head in tight, crisp curls, the thin lips were
compressed, the whole being seemed to palpitate with
concentrated vitality, and yet it was a wreck, or why
was he lying there?</p>

<p>He welcomed Herriard with a smile which held more
than mere greeting.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are late, Geof. A field-night of course. Well?&#8221;</p>

<p>Herriard took the hand that was raised towards him,
then wheeled round a chair and sat down.</p>

<p>&#8220;I got on all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s well. So you did speak?&#8221;</p>

<p>Herriard nodded. &#8220;And, I think, made every point
you gave me. They beat us by only thirty-three.&#8221;</p>

<p>The dark eyes lighted up with malicious triumph.
&#8220;Good! That&#8217;s a nasty rap for Master Askew. We
had the logic and they the numbers, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>Herriard gave a short laugh. &#8220;Certainly we got in
our hits every time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s as it should be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They were feeble, and not over-confident after the
first hour. It was quite fun to watch them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Weaklings! Fancy losing their nerve and half their
majority. What are such sheep good for but to follow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
their leader through the hedge? I wish I had been
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>A look of almost passionate regret crossed the man&#8217;s
face as he spoke the last words.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you had, my dear Gastineau. We would
have had more fun still, and they more funk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Congreve?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Spoke for twenty minutes. An exhibition of the
superior person in the throes of embarrassment. That
point of yours about the repudiation of the Colonies
hit them hard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, you made the most of that. Good! Congreve
the Superior could not touch it?&#8221; He spoke eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Touch it? He could not get near it. I wished afterwards,
as I listened to his floundering, that I had elaborated
it still more.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gastineau&#8217;s thoughts seemed to be far away; as
though he were living in the scene his brain reconstructed.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t doubt you did very well, my dear
boy,&#8221; he murmured, still preoccupied. Suddenly he
flashed out with a spiteful laugh, &#8220;The pattern Robert
Congreve at a loss! His Baliol quibbles at a discount
for once. Faugh! A brilliant party to depend for its
allies upon the callow prigs of the Oxford Union! Ah,
to be back again! to be back again!&#8221; His clenched
hand rose and fell; he gave a great sigh of impotence.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is hard on you, old fellow,&#8221; Herriard said sympathetically;
&#8220;cruelly hard. As it is, I only wish that,
as your proxy, I could do you more justice.&#8221;</p>

<p>The look of almost savage impatience on Gastineau&#8217;s
face had given place to a quiet smile as he replied.
&#8220;I could not find a better man for my purpose, Geof.
We must both of us have patience,&#8221; he gave a short<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
bitter laugh, &#8220;a virtue that you should find easier to
practise than I, since its exercise need last but a short
time with you, while I must die of it. But the <i>savoir
attendre</i> pays, Geof, both in the House and at the Bar.&#8221;</p>

<p>Herriard smiled. &#8220;That&#8217;s just as well, since one has
no option but to wait.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gastineau gave a quick shake of the head. &#8220;Many
men won&#8217;t wait; they can&#8217;t play the game. The world
thinks they are waiting, and they flatter themselves
so too. But they are really out of it, Geof. They have
shot their bolt and missed. Why? Because they were
in a hurry. Then there are others, like this fellow Congreve,
who get pushed up by the stupid party that
mistakes academical show and froth for real power.
They manage to keep balanced on their pedestals by
the weights of self-advertisement and self-confidence.
They act upon the well-known ethical principle that
the majority of mankind, being fools too lazy to think
for themselves, will appraise a man at his own value,
if only he will take care to proclaim the precious figure
in season and out. If I were a living instead of a dead
man, Geoffrey, I&#8217;d blow that fellow out of the water
in which he swims so complacently.&#8221;</p>

<p>Perhaps it was his glance at the malignant face beneath
him that made Herriard remark, &#8220;You are a
good hater, Gastineau.&#8221;</p>

<p>In an instant the sinister expression had relaxed.
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; with a half-apologetic smile. &#8220;I hate prigs
and, above all, the superior person, with his impudence
in assuming a rank in the human category to which
he is not in the least entitled. Ah, well, you shall
smash him up for me one of these days, Geof. I&#8217;m
going to make a real, a brilliant success of you. When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
you are perfect in your guard, I am going to teach you
how to hit still harder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is very good of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense! If you knew how much of selfishness
there is in my tuition you would not give me much
credit. I shouldn&#8217;t expect you to let me use you as a
mask for my battery were it not that the benefits of
my marksmanship go to you. There, that&#8217;s enough of
that. Now, about these briefs. I have looked through
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are all simple enough, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Absolutely. In Slater <i>v.</i> Sudbury Tramway, though,
I should make a strong point of the contributory negligence
and, as a second shot, cross-examine closely as
to the father&#8217;s actual income and financial position and
prospects. I see they claim six thousand. A glorious
British jury is pretty sure to find against you, and your
best point will be to suggest a try-on and go for mitigation.
There you are.&#8221;</p>

<p>He gave Herriard the parcel of briefs with an encouraging
smile and nod of confidence. &#8220;Now you had
better turn in,&#8221; he said, &#8220;or you won&#8217;t be fit for Court
in the morning. Who tries the tramway case?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gartree.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That old fool? He will probably misdirect, and give
you a second chance. Good-night, my dear boy. So
glad you scored to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>They shook hands affectionately, and in another
minute Herriard, in spite of a long, exciting day, was
walking, with the brisk step of that elation which knows
no fatigue, towards his rooms in Mount Street.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br />


<small>THE HISTORY OF A COMPACT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THREE years earlier there had been an appalling
railway accident between Cordova and Seville.
Two tightly packed trains had come into collision, with
results that had prevented even the Spanish officials
from hushing up the <i>contretemps</i>, and had sent an electric
wave of shudders over the whole news-reading world.
Among the second division of its victims, the dangerously,
even mortally, wounded, there appeared one name
at least which added, in England, at any rate, to the
sensational interest which for nearly a week the affair
induced. It was that of the most prominent coming
man of the day, Paul Gastineau, K.C., M.P., a man who
had indeed arrived and who was bound, in French
phrase, to go far. Lay politicians were fond of quoting
one another that a man of such marvellous brain-power
and capability for hard work had the easy and certain
reversion to the Woolsack: members of his own branch
of the profession, if they did not agree with the forecast,
let it pass unchallenged; while there were many
grains of intentional truth in the chaff indulged in by
the other branch when they would declare that the solicitor,
who, having a fighting case on hand, failed to
retain Paul Gastineau, laid himself open to an action
for negligence.</p>

<p>For Gastineau was above all things a fighter, and
one who fought with his brains as well as with his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
tongue; a distinction which they who know courts of
law will readily appreciate. An awkward adversary,
ever in deadly earnest, who always fenced with the button
off; his enemies and defeated opponents, and they
were many, said not too scrupulously; but he fought
to win, and usually did win, leaving mere niceties and
quibbles to the schoolmen; and to have the knack of
winning means much, if not everything. It meant much
for Paul Gastineau. He became the most talked about
man at the Bar, and his enemies being too human to
let his praises pass in silence, simply added their voices
to the babble that made him known. Our forefathers
were stupid enough to regard the envy, hatred and
malice that attend on success as something of a drawback;
a toll, they called it, paid for being eminent: we
know better, and nowadays the wisely successful man
regards his detractors as a valuable asset in the working
capital on which he pursues the business of eminence.</p>

<p>Parties in the political world do not look far or seek
beneath the surface for their allies. Perhaps they are
too busy, or too lazy; not to suggest that they are
too stupid. Anyhow they have a well-defined leaning
towards ready-made reputations: the practice may be
expensive and exacting, but it saves trouble. Once
Gastineau had become an established success his Party
found that they could not do without him, and to that
success and to that discovery did a very worthy and
somnolent brewer, whose legislative faculties appeared
to be somewhat clouded by the fumes of his own ale,
owe his more comfortable place of repose in that honourable,
if shunted, <i>wagon-lit</i> called the House of Lords.
Eminent forensic lawyers are often failures in Parliament,
and Gastineau was clever enough at the Bar to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
make wiseacres pretty sure of his falling short in the
House. But the short-sighted soothsayers who judge
the individual from the aggregate had made no allowance
for a certain quality which, beyond his grit, his
talent, and his power of concentration, was to be an
important factor in the success which he forthwith became.
They forgot that he was not altogether an Englishman:
there was Southern blood in his veins, a
warmer tinge to his mind; he had the vivacity and
intellectual <i>chic</i> of the Italian added to the determination
of an Englishman. So he rose almost at a bound to a
high position among the legal members of the House,
and with that his position seemed assured.</p>

<p>Naturally when it was seen that this distinguished
man was among the victims of the Spanish railway
smash, something like a thrill ran through the country
which was the stage of his career. Society speculated
as to the extent of his injuries and his chance of recovery;
his own profession believed, many of them hoped,
that, even if he did recover, his flight would thenceforward
be a drooping one, while our old friend, the
man in the street, always ready with an obvious moral
platitude, made much of the impending sword which
Fate hangs over the heads of even the most brilliantly
successful of poor humanity.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in a poor monastery near an obscure Spanish
town Gastineau lay battling with characteristic determination
to keep at bay Death who stood over him.
When he had been extricated from the wreckage of the
train he was placed aside on the ground to await means
of removal to the improvised hospital; and he had lain
there in what, to a man of his character and ambition,
far exceeded the bitterness of death. His spine was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
injured, he felt no pain, was, indeed, scarcely conscious
of the strange numbness and deprivation of all muscular
power. But, after the first stunning shock, his
mind had become, even for him, abnormally clear and
alert, the change from lethargic dizziness had come like
the clearing off of vapours from the sun. &#8220;Thank
Heaven,&#8221; he muttered to himself, &#8220;this is the end, the
lightning before death; if only it will come quickly, for
all is over with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>So in a state of savage, resentful impatience he lay
there, looking up at the stars, all unconcerned in their
cold glitter, types of the all-enduring, which mocked
that poor transient clay which had aspired to be a planet
in a system so mundane as to admit of railway accidents;
and as he looked with despairing eyes he cursed them
as the unjust rulers of his fate. Then, for his mind was
in too great a state of exaltation to dwell long on any
one thought, before him rose and passed as in an extraordinarily
vivid panorama the salient incidents of
his career, to be succeeded by the principal stages he
had been wont justifiably to picture in his future.
Never to be. The past was all he could claim now;
the present was mere impotence, and the future had
vanished at the touch of a sleepy signalman&#8217;s hand on
the wrong lever. He ground his teeth as he thought of
it; he had a good deal of cynical philosophy in him,
but it failed here, the stake had been too great, the
certainty of winning too absolute for him to regard this
startling reverse with equanimity. Then he came to
review his triumphs, his mistakes, his sins: the last had
been mostly pleasant, none the less so, perhaps, that
his ambition had required their concealment; he felt
he would rather have lived for sin, flagrant, even, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
open, than died like this. If he had known how near
the end was he would not have been so careful; the
world&#8217;s opinion, bah! What was it worth now? Something
came to his mind that since the jar of the accident
he had strangely forgotten; something that had
sent him there, sent him, as it turned out, to his death.
Was there justice in that? Curiously his legally trained
mind began to busy itself in weighing the equity of the
penalty. It was at least strangely swift, fitting and
thorough, but was it just? <i>Summum jus, summa injuria.</i>
He smiled resentfully at the aptness of the adage,
then became conscious that some one was speaking to
him, was sympathetically asking as to his hurt. A
young man knelt by his side and, with a cushion, tried
to make his position more comfortable, talking cheerily
to him the while. He was one of the uninjured passengers
doing his best for his less fortunate fellow travellers.
For the moment Gastineau hated his succourer
in a wave of malicious envy; why had not this nobody,
this worthy, common-place young Englishman, dull,
probably, and mentally circumscribed, with the hallmark
of Eton plainly showing, why had not this man
been shattered, and he, the brilliant worker, with a
name and a place in the world, have gone scatheless?
So bitter was the selfish thought that for a while he
could hardly bring himself to acknowledge the young
stranger&#8217;s kindness; all he wanted was to be let alone,
to die quickly. But the other was not to be easily rebuffed;
perhaps he made allowance for a sufferer&#8217;s state
of mind and temper; anyhow he soon won, by tactful
assiduity, the wounded man&#8217;s gratitude, to such a degree,
indeed, that when they came to bear Gastineau to
the monastery he begged the young fellow not to leave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
him. There self came in again, since other sufferers
might need the young Samaritan&#8217;s care; but the case
seemed desperate, and he could not bear to refuse a
manifestly dying man&#8217;s request.</p>

<p>In such manner began the friendship between Paul
Gastineau and Geoffrey Herriard.</p>

<p>Now, within the next few days, chance, that had
brought Gastineau to this pass, continued a sequel which
had a singular and important bearing upon the future
of the two men it had thrown together. Gastineau,
having been carried to the monastery and tended by
the monks, ever ready for such an office of mercy, lay
for days in a semi-comatose condition on the borderland
between life and death. He was but one of some
dozen victims under the care of these good brothers
who, simple and practically dead to the world beyond
their narrow sphere, took little heed of their patients&#8217;
identities; they were to them simply suffering men whose
pain called forth their loving service. Presently, to
their joy and Herriard&#8217;s satisfaction, Gastineau, who
had seemed doomed, began to mend. He regained in
a surprising degree his mental faculties; the doctor
shook his head at any idea of complete recovery; he
could never walk again, but, with care till the crisis
was well past, he would live. It was wonderful, wonderful,
he declared; not one man in a thousand would
have survived such an injury, but the vitality of the
<i>Se&ntilde;or Inglese</i> was the most marvellous he had ever
known; it was a revelation; and, after all, though most
of us die when we need not, there are some subjects
whom it is absurdly difficult to kill. But then look at
him. Did one ever see such unmistakable power in any
one as this dark, resolute Englishman manifested?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
Were all mankind built of that steel-like fibre physicians
would be few. But to give him the best chance
it would be well to remove him to the air of the mountains,
and the sooner it was done the better.</p>

<p>Accordingly, early one morning, the patient, accompanied
by Herriard, was driven off on a journey of
some half-dozen leagues to the restorative atmosphere
the doctor had suggested.</p>

<p>Now it happened that, an hour after their departure,
death, as though determined not to be twice baulked,
struck his dart at one of the patients who remained
at the monastery, an Englishman also, a stockbroker
of travelling proclivities whose proposed itinerary had
scarcely included the River Styx. During the morning
the reporter of the local paper, who had, from the
columns of a Madrid &#8220;contemporary,&#8221; discovered that
an Englishman of note was among the wounded (a fact
which he had totally failed to get wind of at first hand),
bustled up to the monastery with an eye to &#8220;copy&#8221;
and the unusual importance of a series of press telegrams
to the capitals of Europe. Only to be told that the
Englishman had died that morning. Too disgusted at
a lost opportunity to enquire more closely as to the
identity of the deceased, he jumped to the conclusion
that it was of course the eminent advocate and distinguished
member of the British Parliament who was
dead, and hurried off in sorrow to his office, formulating
his dispatch by the way. So it came to be flashed
abroad that Paul Gastineau had, as expected, succumbed
to his injuries.</p>

<p>Herriard reading the news some days after was hot
on contradicting it, and greatly surprised when Gastineau
forbade him to do so.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>&#8220;Let it be,&#8221; he commanded. &#8220;It is scarcely a mistake.
I am dead. Yes; considering what my life has
been, as really dead as many a man who is in his grave.
Let it be so, Herriard; give me your word that you will
not set the mistake right. I will tell you why presently.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was so evidently in earnest, that Herriard could
not refuse to pass his word, unaccountable as the request
seemed. Yet, perhaps, to him who, being a humble
member of the same profession, knew well his companion&#8217;s
position and character therein, it was just conceivable
that this brilliant and ambitious man could
not bear to swallow fate&#8217;s nauseous dose in public. If
we have to make a wry face we need not stand in the
market-place to do it.</p>

<p>So it came to pass that the report of Gastineau&#8217;s
death was never contradicted; he was supposed to have
been buried in an obscure Spanish grave; obituary notices
appeared in the papers, and the very fact that
these were allowed to pass unchallenged practically
confirmed their truth. This business of a supposititious
death would, however, have been difficult to carry out
successfully had it not been helped by the circumstance
that Gastineau stood, so far as family ties were concerned,
almost alone in the world. There was no near
relative to go out to Spain and make enquiries, even
as a pious duty. Such distant cousins as he had were
poor, for he had raised himself; he had never encouraged
any advances they had attempted, and they accepted
the news of his death with little more interest
than the rest of the world. So when presently it appeared
that he had left to his friend Geoffrey Herriard
a life interest in his property the relations had scarcely
an excuse for a grievance.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>But when once the deception had been decided on,
the busy, acute brain, as keen as ever, set to work
strenuously to perfect all the details of the business.
And something more. The hidden light was to burn
as brightly as ever behind its screen of lies; the dead
hand was to strike as viciously as of old, the stilled voice
to sting through other lips. Gastineau studied Herriard
and came to the conclusion that he was fitted for the
purpose he had in mind. He could have done with a
little less honesty, but the scheme in its very character
contained an element which would neutralize that.
Paul Gastineau was not going to play the dead man
in aught save in name. He was still a power. The
sword with which he had fought and gained so many
encounters had snapped in his hand, but he would do
some savage execution yet with the jagged dagger it
had become. He was not going to lie still and impotently
watch the unchecked triumphs of the rivals and
enemies he hated and despised. The sole sharer of his
secret was clever, ambitious, sick of waiting for his
chance, and, by Heaven, he should have it.</p>

<p>Accordingly he one day considerably startled Herriard
by proposing to him a scheme, extraordinary
enough, yet of obvious feasibility. It was simply this:
That they should return to London secretly, and that
he, Gastineau, out of gratitude for the services rendered
him, should repay service for service by putting the
whole of his great talents at his young friend&#8217;s disposal
to the furtherance of his career. Herriard, in a word,
was to be the mouthpiece of the stricken man&#8217;s brain.
Gastineau should be the dramatist and stage-manager,
Herriard the actor, the manifest form of the invisible
spirit.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>&#8220;I will make you, Geoffrey,&#8221; he protested, warming
to kindle the necessary enthusiasm in his intended
pupil. &#8220;Your fortune at the Bar, that will be child&#8217;s
play; I will guarantee for you, if I live, something
higher, a prize more glorious than mere money. Don&#8217;t
think of that; leave money-grubbing to tradesmen;
more than enough for everything a man can want will
come of course, for you cannot march successfully
through our profession without the accompaniment of
the golden cymbals! But if I take you in hand as I
propose, there is no saying where you will stop. Because
I am at the end of my tether, which has pulled
me up with an ugly jerk, because I can do no more for
myself, is no reason why, so long as my brains are left
me, I should not do something for another man. No,
don&#8217;t begin to thank me; I am not even pretending that
there is any virtue in my offer. If,&#8221; he laughed, &#8220;I
had still the use of my legs I wouldn&#8217;t do it, that&#8217;s
obvious. I should be too keen on my own career to
trouble much about helping another man on. I should,
if I had completely recovered, have probably given you
a piece of jewellery in acknowledgment of your kindness,
and always been your friend and glad to see you.
I am selfish; all successful men are, although some contrive
to disguise it from a stupid public by advertising
the contrary; it has made me; I don&#8217;t say I could not
have got on without practising selfishness, but it would
have taken me much longer, and time, you know, is of
the essence of our contract with Fate in these days of
hustle, rush and scramble. And it is just that very
instinct of self that now draws me to you; for selfishness
by no means implies ingratitude. Within limits,
they who make self their god are keenly grateful to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
those who serve in his temple. It is just as well to be
honest in a matter of this kind, and for neither of us
to enter upon a contract such as I am proposing with
false impressions. For it must be a contract, my dear
Geoffrey; binding by the very seal of our individual
interests, and to be honourably kept in its spirit as
well as on its material side. It will be necessary for
us to believe in one another, to trust one another.
Those are general stipulations: the only specific conditions
I shall make are, absolute, inviolable secrecy,
which you would hardly break, and, what you may
find less easy to comply with, implicit obedience to my
instructions. I am not surprised to see you look serious
at that, but don&#8217;t misunderstand me. I am not going
to put a knife in your hand and send you forth to murder
one of my pet aversions. I have no intention of
asking you to do anything, to use any weapon which
an ordinary man of the world need in honour, our code
of to-day, shrink from. But if I want a man hit hard
you must hit him hard; you will be my soldier, and
when I send you out to fight I don&#8217;t expect you to
patch up a truce and arbitrate. I have always been a
fighting man, and as my representative, my proxy, you
would have to carry my banner, which bears the motto,
&#8216;No compromise.&#8217; The rewards would be great. If,
as I hardly suppose, my affairs should turn out so that
it became necessary for me to levy toll of your earnings,
I would take care you were no loser by that. I will
get you into the House, and what is more, I will make
you master of the art of making your mark there when
you are in. That is the real crux. That is where nine
out of ten, even clever, men fail. There need be no
limit to your ambition. Every day&#8217;s programme shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
be sketched for you, every wrong turning marked with
a red cross, every pitfall fenced, the right road clearly
marked. You shall see your fellow travellers drop off,
but you shall, if you follow my clue, go on triumphantly,
each milestone marking a new success. The world is
before you to conquer. The world consists mainly of
fools, but even fools get in your way, it is all they can
do, and there are clever spirits to oppose your progress.
The conquest is easy enough, but unhappily men usually
find that out too late, when they are too old for the
fray. I doubt whether you could do it alone, Geoffrey,
at least while the victory is worth having, but with me
behind you, you may be irresistible. Is it a compact?&#8221;</p>

<p>The compact was made readily enough, the chances
of the strange proposal being too dazzling to be rejected.
If the purely ethical side of the arrangement
lodged a feeble protest in Herriard&#8217;s mind, the material
advantage with which it was weighted drove the monitor
out of hearing. Success deferred is to the impatience
of youth more galling, perhaps, than the settled
disappointment of failure to a maturer mind. From
Herriard success, the immediate success which a fairly
clever and ambitious man expects to be his, had been
withheld to a degree that had begun to gall him. Other
men of his standing, no cleverer but more pushing, or
more lucky, than he, were forging ahead. We are never
so conscious of our slow progress as when we see ourselves
left behind by others who started with us. Here,
ready to Herriard&#8217;s hand, was a means of catching up
and passing his rivals, indeed of astonishing his world.
It seemed rather like making a compact with the devil,
he would tell himself with a laugh; yet where, he argued,
was the wrong? He was going to rob no one; it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
merely a partnership that he was entering into, and the
success of a partnership is gauged by its strongest rather
than its weakest member. Why should a bed-ridden
man of genius be debarred from the active exercise of
his mental powers? Where was the dishonour in being
his spokesman, any more than his amanuensis?</p>

<p>So the argument went all one way; the strange partnership
began, and was not long in justifying its existence.
Men who frequented the fruitful and thorny
paths of the law began to speak of Geoffrey Herriard
as one of the cleverest of rising counsel; some, speculating
in &#8220;futures&#8221; out of the capital of their reputation
for foresight, pointed at him as the coming man.
He went far to justify them by the lucky capture of a
seat at a bye-election, the victory being in some measure
due to a series of particularly smart and telling speeches,
which tore into shreds the platform of his opponent, a
flabby soap-maker with a long purse and a short vocabulary.
Herriard&#8217;s maiden speech was a success. &#8220;Best
I&#8217;ve heard since poor Paul Gastineau,&#8221; Sir Henry Hartfield
commented.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather reminds me of him,&#8221; his companion remarked.
&#8220;Something of the same fiery periods and
tendency to antithesis. It just shows how easily a
man&#8217;s place can be filled, even the cleverest.&#8221;</p>

<p>The resemblance in style was indeed remarkable both
at the Bar, on the platform, and in the House, for in
the early day of his pupildom Herriard had to keep
tight and assiduous hold on his master&#8217;s hand. The
work was hard, but the tutor was clever in imparting
his knack, and, with a reputation increasing to a flattering
degree, the incentive to industry on the pupil&#8217;s
part was great.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>Every night Herriard paid a visit to the secluded
house in Mayfair, sometimes to stay far into the early
hours of the morning, rehearsing a speech, analyzing
the probable trends of a cross-examination, making
notes from Gastineau&#8217;s quick observation of weak points
or strong ones, spotting flaws, devising traps, in fact
looking to every rivet in his own armour, speculating
on every possible loose joint in his adversaries&#8217; for the
morrow&#8217;s tilt.</p>

<p>So the singular conjunction of rare master and apt
pupil had continued in almost unbroken success for
more than three years. Herriard had gained such a
degree of confidence in playing his part as now almost
to wear his instructor&#8217;s talent at second-hand. He
promised to become a rich man, and Gastineau, with
ample means of his own for his circumscribed luxury,
was pleased that it should be so. In return for wealth
and reputation he expected Herriard to mark down,
to follow up and worry certain old-time rivals of his
own. His pupil sometimes marvelled at the malignant
viciousness of his &#8220;riding orders.&#8221; It was as though
Gastineau had given him a rhetorical bottle of vitriol
to fling over the smug face of some self-satisfied prig
of an Under Secretary. Still he felt in honour bound
to fling the corrosive denunciations with the most stinging
effect, very much to the distortion of the Superior
Being&#8217;s cultivated blandness. Then Gastineau was wont
to declare himself well satisfied; and perfect friendship,
founded on mutual service, existed between the two men.</p>

<p>But strange events, little dreamt of by either, were
on their way to meet them; events which were to turn
into disastrous twistings the paths that had run so
easily side by side.</p>

<small>A SOCIETY SENSATION</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;HAVE you heard the latest sensation, Lady Rotherfield?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, Mr. Greetland. Do tell me. It&#8217;s not the
scandal about Lord Barnoldby and Infanta Turnour?
Of course every one knows all about that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hardly all, dear lady,&#8221; Greetland simpered. He
was one of the cohort of smart diners-out; the social
bagmen who all travel in the same commodity, for which
there is universal demand&mdash;scandal. &#8220;The Barnoldby-Turnour
affair is never-ending. Nobody ever will hear
the last of that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Infanta is old enough to know better,&#8221; observed
Mrs. Hargrave on the other side of him, scandalized but
interested.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is big enough at any rate,&#8221; Greetland smirked.</p>

<p>&#8220;To be ashamed of herself,&#8221; supplemented Lady
Rotherfield illogically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps she has out-grown the sense of shame,&#8221;
suggested Greetland, whose stature matched his ambition.
&#8220;But that wasn&#8217;t what I was referring to. Something
much more thrilling.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Greetland!&#8221;</p>

<p>The society purveyor glanced round to see whether
he had an audience worthy of the news. People on
each side seemed to be pricking up their ears. There
was evidently something of interest going forward; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
spasmodic tea-table talk languished; Dormer Greetland
was always interesting; even men who itched to kick
him admitted that. &#8220;A curiously marked caterpillar&#8221;
had once been Gastineau&#8217;s correction when some one
spoke of Greetland as a worm. He was too sleek and
foppish to be a human exemplar of the more coarse and
naked invertebrate.</p>

<p>A pretty piece of scandal was evidently forthcoming,
and he got an audience to his liking&mdash;almost every one
of importance in the room, with one notable exception,
the hostess, Countess Alexia von Rohnburg, who was
listening to a prosy Russian diplomat.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it? You have some news for us, Greetland?&#8221;
cried the high-pitched voice of Baron de Daun,
as he came across the floor and stood over the group.
In his way the Baron was as great a scandal-monger
and <i>blagueur</i> as the other man, but he tore reputations
to shreds with greater violence than his English <i>confr&egrave;re</i>,
who was, after all, more of an artist. On the other
hand, the Baron had greater justification in peeping
through the chinks in society&#8217;s shutters, for was he not
a diplomatist?</p>

<p>&#8220;A very extraordinary thing has come to light,&#8221;
Greetland said, with an air befitting the communication.
&#8220;It is really quite dramatic, and Heaven only
knows what will be the end of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What? What?&#8221; Baron de Daun&#8217;s temper was
impatient of preliminaries, a circumstance which, however,
was not so great a drawback as it would seem
in his profession, where due weight is given to considerations
other than individual fitness.</p>

<p>&#8220;You remember,&#8221; Greetland proceeded, still deliberately&mdash;on
his own ground it took more than the representative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
of a second-rate power to flurry him&mdash;&#8220;you
remember the affair of poor Beauty Martindale?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes; the poor fellow who died so tragically at
the ball at&mdash;where was it? Yes?&#8221;</p>

<p>To Lady Rotherfield details were unimportant; but
to Greetland they had their value. &#8220;Vaux House,&#8221;
he supplied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes? yes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s see. He was supposed to have died of heart
disease, but it was doubted&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There was no doubt about it,&#8221; de Daun asserted
quickly. The subject was too interesting for more diplomatic
contradiction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; corroborated Sir Perrott Aspall, who
had been in Australia at the time and was consequently
well qualified to give an authoritative dictum. &#8220;He
was murdered, done to death by one of his partners,
eh? That&#8217;s the idea.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I recollect,&#8221; put in Mrs. Hargrave breathlessly.
&#8220;Half the smart women in town were suspected.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Many of whom were not at the dance,&#8221; de Daun
laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s years ago,&#8221; Lady Rotherfield said, as an excuse
for general vagueness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what of it? What has come to light?&#8221; the
Baron demanded. &#8220;Get on, my dear fellow, if you
have anything to tell us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Greetland, master of the situation, was content to
wait till the chatter stopped. &#8220;The facts were these.
Reggie Martindale, the handsomest man in town, was
found dead at the Lancashires&#8217; dance. You are quite
right, dear lady, it was at first supposed and given out
that it was heart disease. Then, almost by accident,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
and after the certificate had been given, a tiny wound,
scarcely bigger than a pin-prick, was found in his left
side near the heart. That was hushed up; luckily the
Lancashires&#8217; medico, who found it out, happened to be
Martindale&#8217;s as well, and so had the matter in his own
hands; and naturally the Duchess did not want a scandal.
It was said that Dr. Blaydon handed the Duke
three-eights of an inch of broken steel which he had
found imbedded in poor Beauty&#8217;s heart, and received
in return a cheque which established a record price
for the metal. But old Blaydon knew himself to be
a dying man at the time; an <i>expos&eacute;</i> could hardly hurt
him, and he had a large family to provide for. As
a matter of fact he died a few months afterwards, to
the dear Duchess&#8217;s great content. It&#8217;s extraordinary
how fussy some good people can be over the idea of a
scandal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; observed Mrs. Hargrave, &#8220;the Duchess
does not require advertisement for herself or her dances.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it had been that terrible Oglander woman, now,
she would have paid the doctor to call in the Coroner,
and sent out invitations for the inquest, with reserved
seats and champagne for the Press.&#8221; Lady Rotherfield
never missed an opportunity, even when she was
in a hurry, of girding at her especial abomination among
the many parvenues who beset her path.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well? well?&#8221; Baron de Daun&#8217;s sharp voice split
the air like the crack of a whip. &#8220;And now, after all,
the affair has come out, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Something more than that,&#8221; Greetland returned,
with all the superiority of the man who knows. &#8220;A
good many people knew that much already. You see,
after Blaydon&#8217;s death, when she felt they were safe,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
the dear Duchess allowed herself to be a little indiscreet,
of course only in her own set.&#8221; His tone included himself
by implication in the select band who shared the
ducal secret. De Daun saw it was no use trying to
hurry him, and worked off his impatience by pulling
viciously at his moustache.</p>

<p>&#8220;What I am going to tell you,&#8221; Greetland proceeded,
&#8220;happened only a day or two ago. They were doing
something to the little room where Beauty was found
dead, just off the ball-room, putting up new cornices
or something&mdash;not before they were wanted, they say
the curtains at Vaux House were hung in Queen Anne&#8217;s
time; probably the poles date from the Conquest&mdash;well,
in pulling the old window trappings about, the men
found a long jewelled hair-pin, a tiny sword, the hilt
set in diamonds and with the point broken off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove!&#8221; exclaimed Sir Perrott.</p>

<p>&#8220;They found this in the cornice?&#8221; de Daun asked
intently. It was important for him to get the story
correctly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Somewhere stuck away in the curtains or behind
the shutter; anyhow, hidden by the window.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And who found it? A workman, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One of the Duke&#8217;s men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what is to be the upshot?&#8221; Mrs. Hargrave&#8217;s
turn of mind was practical and anticipatory.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, the whole thing will come out,&#8221; Greetland
asserted.</p>

<p>&#8220;No? Be made public?&#8221; Lady Rotherfield was
dead against the publicity of to-day. A scandal to
which the mob had access lost all its piquancy and was
not worth discussing. The world was becoming less
interesting every hour.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>&#8220;To-morrow,&#8221; Greetland confidently affirmed, &#8220;the
man in the street will know as much of the affair as we
do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Rotherfield gave a shrug of despair. The world
where the man in the street is as well posted as the
Duchess in the Square was scarcely worth living in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then the Duke can&#8217;t hush it up this time, eh?&#8221;
de Daun demanded, showing his malicious teeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Greetland purred on. &#8220;He is in an awful
way about it, and the Duchess is having a bad time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor woman!&#8221; cried Mrs. Hargrave with cynical
sympathy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it is all her fault, so Lady Helen says,&#8221; the
Society Newsman went on, as suavely as though he
were referring to no greater tragedy than a failure on
the Matrimonial Exchange. &#8220;The dear Duchess would
dismiss one of her carriage footmen because he was
three-quarters of an inch shorter than his fellow. Lady
Helen&#8217;s maid tells her that the man wore cork wedges
in his boots till he could hardly keep his balance, and
was quite willing to meet her views and obliging, but
the other day he had to go out unexpectedly, and in
his hurry forgot the corks; the Duchess&#8217;s eagle eye
caught the disparity, her artistic sense was outraged,
and the poor Duke had to give the man notice. She
said that so long as Nature continued occasionally to
turn out human beings six feet two inches in height she
would not put up with a trumped-up, inferior article,
only six feet one, of which a quarter only was genuine
flesh and blood and the rest cork, and who looked as
though liable to fall on his nose. Men of her standard
height were to be had, and she meant to have them,
all through alike; the cork-tipped variety she would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
leave to Bishop&#8217;s wives, dowager Countesses, and other
latitudinarians.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So like the dear Duchess,&#8221; Lady Rotherfield laughed.
&#8220;Poor Duke, what could he say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There was only one thing he could say to the man.
Well, the fellow resented his dismissal, which was rather
absurd of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He ought to have been thankful to get rid of the
corks,&#8221; was Sir Perrott&#8217;s opinion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Instead of which he appears to have declared that
the proper thing for the Duchess to have done was to
have sacked his tall colleague and replaced him by a
man to match himself, minus the corks. This was flat
treason in the face of the fact that the standard height
of the Lancashires&#8217; carriage footmen was settled for all
time in the second year of the reign of William and
Mary. When the <i>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</i> was repeated to the
Duchess she became livid. The sacredness of the
Lancashire traditions to be scoffed at by a cork-mounted
flunkey! Should the ducal glory be belittled
by a creature whose only claim for notice rested upon
a pair of false heels? The consequence was that the
wretched man was told to go on the spot, and that
happened just after the discovery of the compromising
hair-pin.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I see,&#8221; said Sir Perrott.</p>

<p>&#8220;The man thought he would get what he could out
of the ducal <i>m&eacute;nage</i>, and went straight off with his secret
to Hepplethwaite. Hepplethwaite gave him twenty
pounds for it, and resold it within the hour to the Duke
for a hundred and an invitation for his wife to the next
reception at Vaux House.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must remember not to go,&#8221; Lady Rotherfield murmured.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
&#8220;That odious pushing woman tries to work
her way everywhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would have been a grand <i>coup</i> for the Hepplethwaite
group of papers,&#8221; Greetland said; &#8220;and would
have set up their circulation phenomenally, but Hepplethwaite
wants something more than money now.
The Brailsfords of the <i>Daily Comet</i> somehow succeeded
in dining at Montford House last week. Montford wants
advertisement for that ass of a son of his, Darsingham,
who is by way of taking up the New Hibernian question
in the House to keep him out of mischief; and so the
Hepplethwaites were bound to go one better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They say,&#8221; observed Mrs. Hargrave, &#8220;that Hepplethwaite
and Brailsford were office boys together in a
tea warehouse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And,&#8221; put in Sir Perrott, &#8220;they are now running it
neck and neck for a Peerage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shocking!&#8221; Lady Rotherfield groaned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then the Vaux House affair is not to be public property
at all?&#8221; de Daun asked. So long as he could add
it to his <i>dossier</i> the stock of public knowledge might
just as well be the poorer by that pungent scandal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t it come out, though?&#8221; Greetland returned.
&#8220;I haven&#8217;t finished my story. The footman on finding
that the news did not appear in the Hepplethwaite
rags took it to Brailsford, got fifteen pounds for it this
time; and it is going to burst upon a jaded reading public
to-morrow morning. They were to have had it to-day,
only special-sized type had to be cast, and they
were not ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is this thrilling announcement which is being
prepared for us, Mr. Greetland?&#8221;</p>

<p>The tatler looked up with almost a start. The question<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
had been put by Countess Alexia von Rohnburg,
their young hostess, who had joined the group, unnoticed
by Greetland or his listeners, intent as they were
upon the new sensation. The Russian proser had come
to a pause in that flow of shallow talk with which diplomatists
are wont to disguise their thoughts and to cover
the watchful observation of their fellows, and the Countess,
who had caught above the suave murmur a word
or two in de Daun&#8217;s high-pitched voice that had arrested
her, had risen and crossed the room. There was nothing
in her handsome, animated face, the index of a susceptive
mind, that showed more than an almost languid
curiosity, as of one who lived in an atmosphere filled
with tales concerning the great names of the day, and
whose appetite was slightly blunted by the familiar fare.
Nevertheless Greetland, the most studiously composed
man of his world, looked up with an expression of greater
embarrassment than he often permitted himself. And
it was de Daun, not he, who answered the question.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Greetland was telling us of the discovery of a
hair ornament, a small jewelled dagger with the point
broken off, in the room at Vaux House where Captain
Martindale met his death two years ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! How thrilling!&#8221; If the speaker were really
thrilled the mobile face must surely have indicated it
more vividly. A wave of interest passed across it; the
dark curves of the eyebrows rose and fell, that was all.
Dormer Greetland, watching the face intently for a man
in whose social balance-sheet manners stood as a notable
asset, saw no more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it quite true, Mr. Greetland?&#8221; The tone implied
an amount of incredulity which compelled a spirited
justification.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>&#8220;Absolutely, Countess. I was just saying that the
discovery will be in the papers to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>His questioner smiled. &#8220;Does that make it true?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will at least bring the story to its proof. The
Duchess won&#8217;t let it pass if it is a canard: she doesn&#8217;t
need advertisement. But I happen to know it is quite
true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure Mr. Greetland would rather be dull than
unauthentic, as the lesser of the two crimes.&#8221; The
sarcasm was none the less stinging from being shot
through the sweetest of smiles.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Duke has been trying to hush it up,&#8221; Lady
Rotherfield put in.</p>

<p>Countess Alexia laughed. &#8220;All the details complete.
And of course the owner of the sword has been found.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think not,&#8221; said Greetland.</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably the Duke knows, as he was so anxious to
hush up the affair,&#8221; the Countess continued, in her fascinating
banter. &#8220;Poor Duke, he had better be careful,
or he will be arrested as what you call an accessory after
the fact, which would be a sensation, if you like. Always
supposing, that is, that poor Reggie Martindale did not
die of heart disease.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That has been clearly proved, Countess,&#8221; Greetland
said, glad of one firm foothold in stemming the increasing
flow of increduilty.</p>

<p>Alexia gave a shrug. &#8220;I never heard it, and I&#8217;m
afraid I hear most things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Duke hushed that up,&#8221; explained Sir Perrott.</p>

<p>&#8220;How clever of him! With that talent for hushing
tiresome tongues what a perfect nursemaid he might
have been if he hadn&#8217;t been born a Duke and a man.
How lucky he has failed this time, or we should not be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
having the sensation of the jewelled dagger, the false
lover and the fair assassin. What hard lines! What
a warning to inconstant young men and fussy Dukes.
And we are to see it all in print to-morrow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get the <i>Daily Comet</i> for choice, Countess,&#8221; de Daun
grinned.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will, indeed. I am so sorry for the poor Duke.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the lady, the owner of the tell-tale weapon?&#8221;
Greetland suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes. But it is so long ago. Our sympathy by
this time is probably superfluous. Our tragedies to-day
are almost as short-lived as our comedies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And almost as amusing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Much more, to the spectators. Having left the art
of pure comedy behind us with the days of patches and
powder and red heels, we have taken a lesson from our
stage managers and learnt to turn a tiresome tragedy
into a roaring farce. It is easy enough. Play with a light
touch, and exaggerate the sentiment, that&#8217;s the way to
get your laughs and your audience; the world must be
amused at any cost. Oh, Prosper&#8221;; she broke off, and
called to her brother, Count Prosper von Rohnburg, who
had just come in with a scientific-looking man, &#8220;have
you heard anything of the wonderful tale Mr. Greetland
has been telling us, how they have found at Vaux House
the weapon with which that poor Captain Martindale is
supposed to have been killed? Isn&#8217;t it thrilling?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he answered, speaking with a foreign accent
far more pronounced than his sister&#8217;s. &#8220;I am behind
the world to-day. There was no time to go to the
Clubs, we have been absurdly busy at the Embassy.
Here, Alix, let me present to you Doctor Hallamar who
has come to spend a little time in England.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>Doctor Hallamar bent his leonine head with its mass of
obstreperous hair low till his lips touched the Countess&#8217;s
hand. Manifestly he was a man of power, the keen,
resolute face was of the kind that makes one glad to
think its indicative strength has taken up arms against
our common enemy, disease.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are taking a holiday in England, Doctor,&#8221;
Alexia enquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hardly.&#8221; The deep tones sounded in unison with
the rest of the man&#8217;s heroic fibre. &#8220;My visit is professional
primarily, but I hope to see something of England
during my enforced stay; if not of its scenery, at
least of its scientific side.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Doctor Hallamar means the hospitals,&#8221; the Count
laughed. &#8220;He would rather see an interesting operation
than the finest view in the world. You know the
Doctor is the only man in Europe who can cure a certain
form of disease.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hallamar smiled deprecatingly. &#8220;Let us say, treat
it, Count. I fear I cannot often undertake to cure it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you are modest, Doctor,&#8221; Alexia laughed.
&#8220;And you have come over to attend a special case?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hallamar bowed assent. &#8220;A lady who has lost the
use of her limbs through an accident. As a diplomatist&#8217;s
sister, Countess, you will not expect me to say
more.&#8221; He beamed inscrutably through his spectacles.
&#8220;My mission may be a failure, and then the less we
shall have said about it the better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine you a failure, Doctor,&#8221; Alexia said,
and truly, as her eyes rested with admiration on the
strong, resourceful face.</p>

<p>Hallamar&#8217;s smile had a touch of regret now.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would, Countess, that your gracious words did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
carry with them to me the sting of unintended
satire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is all this about the discovery at Vaux House?&#8221;
Count Prosper asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, we are to have the whole account to-morrow
in the papers,&#8221; his sister replied. &#8220;We can scarcely
trouble Mr. Greetland to go over the story again.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Mayfair newsman seemed not disinclined to repeat
the recitation to a, perhaps, more appreciative
listener; but the Count, accustomed to take his sister&#8217;s
slightest hint, abandoned any further show of curiosity.
But he said presently, &#8220;We were at that ball at Vaux
House, weren&#8217;t we, Alix? Yes; I recollect poor Martindale.
Good-looking fellow he was.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You remember the sensation his death caused,&#8221;
Sir Perrott said. &#8220;Half the smart women in town,
married and single, were supposed to be hit by it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Doctor Hallamar&#8217;s smile had faded. He was not interested
and he showed it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Baron de Daun and Dormer Greetland rose to go at
the same time. Greetland&#8217;s adieux were the more
lengthy; he had so many social loose ends to tie up.
It seemed when he reached the hall that de Daun must
have been waiting for him. They went out together.</p>

<p>&#8220;Serious thing this about Vaux House,&#8221; the Baron
remarked, in quite a concerned voice. &#8220;I say, Greetland,
between ourselves, was the Countess,&#8221; he gave
a jerk of the head in the direction of the house they had
just left, &#8220;one of the women talked of with Martindale?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I fancy she was,&#8221; the other answered, looking
straight in front of him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>Tatler as he was, he knew de Daun, and did not care
to be pumped to serve the thirst of that blatant young
diplomat.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seemed rather curious, to say the least of it,&#8221;
his companion persisted, &#8220;her affecting to doubt the
truth of the story. I wonder if the sword hair-pin was
hers.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked round at Greetland with the quick turn
of a bird of prey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s going too far,&#8221; Greetland cried, throwing
up his hand half way in protest, then full length to
hail a passing hansom.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br />


<small>THE DUCAL POINT OF VIEW</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE <i>Daily Comet</i> came out next day with its threatened
sensational blazon: the world of London and
beyond greedily assimilated the startling tale, and their
Graces the Duke and Duchess of Lancashire began to
have an exceedingly unpleasant time of it. The Duke
especially; since he had the Duchess, as well as the
Press and the rest of the world, to encounter. He had
done nothing wrong (with the exception of that bribe
to the late Dr. Blaydon) or even foolish, he told himself,
for his little arrangement with the doctor had been
highly expedient; yet the affair had, by the merest
chance, taken this unfortunate turn, and he suddenly
found his ducal neck and wrists in a moral pillory, with
a shower of rotten eggs unpleasantly imminent. Under
the circumstances he judged it wise to confine his perambulations
within the precincts of Vaux House; happily
its grounds were extensive, and for the first time
in his life as he dispiritedly paced them, he omitted to
regret the waste they represented of colossally remunerative
building sites. He simply dared not show his face
in the streets&mdash;not even the streets that he owned&mdash;and
as to going into one of his clubs, including the House of
Lords, why, he would as soon have walked into the
crater of Vesuvius. So he promenaded up and down
and around the somewhat dingy gardens of which the
sombre and blighted tone was in complete harmony with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
his feelings. He could hear passers-by talking on the
other side of the high wall which secluded his august
pleasure-ground from the vulgar world, and wondered
if, nay, made sure, they were discussing him and his
methods in a spirit of galling irreverence, if they took
their tone from that of the more enterprising journals
he had read. Yes; it was an uncomfortable position for
any one, let alone an old-established Duke; he became
sure certain people were watching him from such upper
windows as commanded a view of the grounds, since the
wall of even an exclusive Duke is subject to certain
architectural limitations; and he went indoors. On his
way he saw people looking curiously through the great
iron gates at the house of mystery and crime. He
fancied he heard a murmur as he crossed their sight,
but that was probably a symptom of hypertrophied
egoism. In his perturbation of mind he flung himself
into a room which he had intended to avoid, and found
himself alone with the Duchess.</p>

<p>There was something in her eye which forbade retreat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; The monosyllable was a challenge: more,
it was the first flick of a castigation.</p>

<p>The Duke merely gave a shrug which was the most
non-committal answer that occurred to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the latest?&#8221; the Duchess demanded, in a
tone which was not to be trifled with.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have heard nothing, dear. I have not been out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I just saw you come in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From the garden.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you go out?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duke made a stand. &#8220;I don&#8217;t care to, while this
wretched business is in big letters at every corner.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>&#8220;What is that to us? You should be above taking
notice of these halfpenny rags. If you are afraid of
walking on the pavements, have a brougham and drive
down to the Carlton. You ought to hear what people
are saying.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; returned the Duke, with infinite sense, &#8220;the
last person in town to hear what people are really saying.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can go and tell them what you think about
the whole disgusting business,&#8221; said the Duchess.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m hanged if I do,&#8221; the Duke returned. &#8220;If they
have any sense they can guess that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pray what do you expect then I am going to do?&#8221;
the Duchess demanded.</p>

<p>The Duke intimated by a shrug that he had formed
no definite anticipations as to his consort&#8217;s line of conduct.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you were not a fool,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you would know
that people haven&#8217;t any sense. They just accept any
ideas that may be given them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m not going to run about town giving people
ideas,&#8221; the Duke declared sullenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know best how far you are justified in coming
to that decision,&#8221; the Duchess returned, with a world
of meaning behind the mere inoffensive words. &#8220;Then
you mean to let these abominable papers have it all
their own way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you ought to care.&#8221; Her Grace&#8217;s temper was
rising. &#8220;You have no business to be a Duke. You
are a disgrace to your order. You&#8217;ll get a wigging, my
dear boy, when the King hears of it. Don&#8217;t expect me
to come to the rescue, that&#8217;s all. If you don&#8217;t face<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
it out, I shall have to leave town in the height of
the season, and I won&#8217;t leave town, so there!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave town, Isabel? What in the name of common
sense have we done that we should run away?&#8221; The
Duke was getting exasperated.</p>

<p>&#8220;We?&#8221; screamed the Duchess. &#8220;What have you
done? To take trouble and spend money in hushing
a thing up, and then to allow it to come out, at a particularly
awkward time, too, is the method of an imbecile.&#8221;</p>

<p>Like most stupid persons the Duke was sensitive on
the subject of <i>nous</i>, and the Duchess knew it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Imbecile?&#8221; he echoed huskily. &#8220;I was clever
enough for you to marry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You were clever enough to marry me, if you like,&#8221;
she returned, with a puff of scorn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Clever!&#8221; he repeated in turn, in as withering a
voice as he could command. &#8220;The general opinion
at the time, pretty freely expressed, was that I was a
fool.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;General opinion!&#8221; she returned with infinite contempt.
&#8220;The opinion of a lot of women who were mad
to be duchesses. What is your general opinion worth
to-day in this tiresome affair? As worthless and wrong
as usual. No, John, you did a good thing for yourself
when you married me, and you know it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have made you.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was too much. Here was the once Miss Isabel
Grendon, a nobody with a pretty face and trim figure
to whom he had, after much hesitation, played Cophetua,
talking of having made a Duke of eight generations.
&#8220;Made me!&#8221; he cried thickly, in his ducal indignation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
&#8220;I had an idea that the Dukes of Lancashire were made,
as you call it, some hundreds of years before your name
appeared on the roll.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Made? Yes, I dare say; after a fashion. But you
were not worth noticing, even when you had got your
coronets on. Before I took you in hand you were
nobodies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nobodies!&#8221; the Duke could only echo. In this
rarified atmosphere of insult independent argument,
and even utterance, were asphyxiated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nobodies,&#8221; the Duchess maintained with exasperating
insistence. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen your mother waiting in
Johnson and Maxtons to be served and none of the shop
people would notice her. They knew well enough who
she was, and that she had come in to spend half an hour
in buying a few yards of sevenpence-halfpenny lace to
furbish up an old gown which her own housekeeper
wouldn&#8217;t have looked at except to sell to the dustman
to dress his wife in for Hampstead Heath. <i>J&#8217;ai chang&eacute;
tout cela.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you have,&#8221; assented the Duke, recovering his
breath as his wife lost hers. &#8220;And if extravagance
makes a man, you have made me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One owes something to one&#8217;s position,&#8221; argued the
lady.</p>

<p>&#8220;You owe a great deal, my dear, not to say everything,&#8221;
retorted the Duke, in a happy flash.</p>

<p>&#8220;To be Duchess of Lancashire meant next to nothing
before my day,&#8221; her Grace proceeded, ignoring the hit.
&#8220;I saw the possibilities of the position.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt,&#8221; agreed the Duke.</p>

<p>&#8220;And have raised it to its proper level in accordance
with modern ideas. I found you thrown away in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
dusthole, I have polished you up and brought you into
the drawing-room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you indeed? Very obliging of you,&#8221; was all
the Duke could say.</p>

<p>&#8220;You think,&#8221; went on the Duchess, having got again
out of the tanglewood into a straight run, &#8220;you think
that a Duke can go about like an old-clothes man, and
his Duchess like a laundress, and be respected. That
shows what a fool you are, John. You imagine in your
stupidity that people in our position can defy appearances
and do just as we like. So we can; but the
world very soon takes care to show us that if we like
to drop out it won&#8217;t detain us. To-day the world thinks
exactly as much of us as we show it we think of ourselves.
It was all very well while the Feudal System
lingered, and there was no moneyed mob to challenge
us. In these days of shallow pretension and surface
estimation a Duke in a bad hat is thought less of than
a bookmaker in a good one; a dowdy Duchess cannot
hold her own against a smart milliner. The world to-day
does not bother itself to think who you are, and
what your ancestors have been and done, in short what
that bad hat really covers; it wants you to show unmistakably
that you spend your money&mdash;or other peoples&#8217;&mdash;and
add to the general amusement. Everything
is theatrical nowadays, all glitter and show, and the
crowd does not ask itself what the gorgeous scenery looks
like from the back. It is as though people preferred a
highly coloured landscape in the theatre, just canvas,
distemper and limelight, to the real thing on one of our
estates. Yes, John, you are a fool not to see what I&#8217;ve
done for you and your House.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duke accepted the long lecture, not because it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
convinced him or uprooted his belief in the infallibility
of his family ways, but because he was given no chance
of interrupting it. When it had come to an end, he
said, not unnaturally, &#8220;I don&#8217;t quite see what all this
has to do with the present business. What are we going
to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have told you,&#8221; insisted the Duchess. &#8220;Go down
to the clubs and face it out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m damned if I do,&#8221; said the Duke, exasperated
to find his patience had gained him nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you are going to be vulgar&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; began the
Duchess.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going down to the clubs,&#8221; he maintained.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to go, John, and the sooner the better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you I won&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You prefer to skulk here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it hadn&#8217;t been for your unreasonable folly about
that wretched footman&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he began.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to be seen with footmen that don&#8217;t
match for you or anybody. You&#8217;ll be expecting me
next to wear odd gloves or shoes or stockings.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duke was relieved from trying for a reply to
this unanswerable argument by a knock at the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Playford is in the blue drawing-room, your
Grace.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duke glanced rather helplessly at his wife.</p>

<p>&#8220;Show Mr. Playford here,&#8221; she said to the man, with
decision. &#8220;Now we shall hear something of what is
being said in the world outside, which you haven&#8217;t the
pluck to face. Aubrey Playford knows everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>Next moment the omniscient one was shaking hands
with them, and wondering curiously what sort of a <i>t&ecirc;te-&aacute;-t&ecirc;te</i>
he had interrupted. As the Duchess was so smiling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
and the Duke so obviously relieved, he concluded
that he had broken up a row.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it too disgustingly provoking, this fuss about
that tiresome affair!&#8221; the Duchess said, as soon as they
had settled down. &#8220;These wretched cheap papers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, they must have a sensation,&#8221; Playford answered,
politely sympathetic. &#8220;One comfort is that nobody believes
half they read in them.&#8221;</p>

<p>No one could be better aware than Aubrey Playford
of the falseness of that statement. No one knew better
than he, a keen observer of his kind, that people are
only too greedy to take in everything, without discount,
that can be said or printed to their neighbour&#8217;s obloquy,
or disadvantage, and more particularly when that neighbour
happens to hold a high position. Under some
conditions Playford would have been spiteful enough to
say so, and indulge in a half-hour of moral vivisection;
but that was not his cue nor his purpose to-day.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is altogether most provoking,&#8221; the Duchess declared.
&#8220;What are they saying about it, Aubrey? I
don&#8217;t mean the wretched papers, but at the clubs?&#8221;</p>

<p>Playford gave a shrug. &#8220;What do they ever say at
the clubs beyond what some one tells them to say?&#8221;
he replied, with a cynical contempt that, coming to him
so easily, seemed a characteristic. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t heard
much. Piersfield was full of it, as he would be, but
more in the way of collecting than distributing, and, of
course, little Roddy Arden was making the most of a
new sensation. By the way, it was pretty well known
yesterday among what I call the professionals, Dormer
Greetland and his school, and they naturally made the
most of their twenty-four hours&#8217; start with the news.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duke groaned. &#8220;All through a wretched footman.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
It is terrible to think how mean an instrument
it takes to set the world agog and to bring us into unpleasant
notoriety.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it is nothing,&#8221; said his visitor in a tone between
sympathy and indifference. &#8220;I certainly should not
worry about it if I were you. It won&#8217;t be even a nine
days&#8217; wonder. The Rullington case comes on next Monday;
there will be some pretty disclosures for the mob
in that, and I hear that Lady Rullington has her trunks
ready packed, and is prepared to skip.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duchess raised her eyebrows. &#8220;As bad as that?
It is a pity that a presumably sensible woman as Maud
Rullington was at one time should have such a vague
idea as to where to draw the line.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duke breathed heavily through his set teeth.
&#8220;These liftings of the curtain for the benefit of the mob
are very damaging and regrettable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They are,&#8221; Playford agreed. &#8220;And the man in the
street is getting every day more eager for a peep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The man in the street,&#8221; said the Duke, the phrase
bringing to his mind an unpleasant reminiscence, &#8220;has
been waiting outside my gates all day for a peep. I
don&#8217;t know what we are coming to when our very privacy
is invaded.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a sign of these times of undesirable publicity,&#8221;
Playford answered, almost with a yawn. He had not
come there to listen to his Grace&#8217;s platitudinous complaints,
and was awaiting his opportunity for something
else. As for the Lancashires, why, who can bring himself
to sympathize with a Duke and Duchess in their
social embarrassments? Are they not considered to
stand too high on their pedestals for the sympathy of
the crowd below to reach them, and to deserve any little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
exposure which their exalted position invites? At any
rate, they were just now but the king and queen of
Aubrey Playford&#8217;s chess-board.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you need fear any pointing of scandal&#8217;s
finger at you,&#8221; he observed, with a confidence-imparting
smile. &#8220;The question which will be agitating
everybody&#8217;s mind, when once they have arrived at the
real bearings of the business, will be, who was the
lady?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes,&#8221; exclaimed the Duke, somewhat relieved.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Aubrey,&#8221; the Duchess protested, &#8220;we are as
much in the dark there as anybody else.&#8221;</p>

<p>Playford&#8217;s dark eyes looked hungrily shrewd. &#8220;You
have no idea, Duchess?&#8221; he asked, with a touch of
incredulity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not the remotest,&#8221; she replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish we had,&#8221; chimed in the Duke, and then fell
to wondering vaguely exactly what he would do with
the information if he had it.</p>

<p>The Duchess had her eyes fixed on her visitor&#8217;s shrewd
face. &#8220;You know, Aubrey?&#8221; she demanded, with a
look of conviction.</p>

<p>Playford&#8217;s astute smile broadened as he shook his
head. &#8220;Not I, Duchess. But I might perhaps give
a guess for what it is worth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s have it,&#8221; cried the Duke, all attention.</p>

<p>Playford looked inscrutable. &#8220;It is dangerous work
guessing,&#8221; he returned, &#8220;unless one has something to
go upon. I was only suggesting it that the hounds of
scandal may prefer to follow that fox to this if there
should be a cross-scent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite so,&#8221; the Duke agreed, none the less confidently
that the idea had never occurred to him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>The Duchess was reflecting. &#8220;We have not much to
go upon,&#8221; she said slowly. &#8220;It was so long ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have,&#8221; suggested Playford, &#8220;the ornament, the
diamond hair-pin, was it not, that the man found?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes.&#8221; She turned to him with alert scrutiny.</p>

<p>&#8220;That won&#8217;t be claimed,&#8221; said the Duke, with a
short laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Claimed! How stupid you are, John!&#8221; Her impatient
exclamation scarcely took her eyes from Playford&#8217;s
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will probably be claimed by Scotland Yard,&#8221;
remarked that gentleman with easy premonition. &#8220;I
am surprised they have not been here yet. I see,
though, they say they have no knowledge of the affair.
So like them. Perhaps they expected to be sent for.
May I see the thing before it goes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The ornament?&#8221; The Duke glanced at his wife
in some hesitation. She had taken the tiresome thing
and locked it up, being in no mood to pander to an
already more than objectionable curiosity. He waited
to see how she would refuse, but she rose, and saying,
&#8220;I will get it,&#8221; left the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Duchess is not going to show it to everybody,&#8221;
said the Duke, with a, possibly manneristic, touch of
patronage.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I shouldn&#8217;t,&#8221; Playford commented, with a
shrewd smile. He thought he knew why he was made
the exception, and was not going to take is as a favour.</p>

<p>His manner, with men at least, Dukes included, was
rather more brusque than his present host liked, so no
word further was spoken till the Duchess returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here it is,&#8221; she said, and unwrapped the tissue
paper from the unhappy piece of evidence. There it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
was. A miniature sword, the blade tarnished gold, the
hilt set with diamonds, and the point broken off.</p>

<p>Playford watched its uncovering eagerly. As it was
disclosed he put out his hand to take it, and, as he did
so, glanced up in the Duchess&#8217;s face. He did not mean
to tell her anything, yet she saw in his eyes something
that said a good deal. Next moment he had turned
away to the light and was scrutinizing the little sword
closely, eagerly, as a man will who wants to carry in
his mind the exact image of an object he may not see
again.</p>

<p>The Duke and Duchess stood behind him in expectant
silence. But they both looked rather blank when
he at length turned to them and affected to be studying
a stain of rust on the blade.</p>

<p>&#8220;That looks as though it might have been blood,&#8221;
he said, tapping it with his finger nail.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hah: do you think so?&#8221; returned the Duke in a
non-committal tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shouldn&#8217;t be surprised,&#8221; Playford replied in an
abominably disappointing way. &#8220;But I&#8217;m not an
analyst.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you recognize the sword, Aubrey?&#8221; asked the
Duchess, with manifestly restrained impatience.</p>

<p>Playford looked at her with a fine assumption of
surprise. &#8220;No. Why? Ought I to?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Do
you know the owner?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you did,&#8221; she returned pointedly.</p>

<p>He handed it back with a laugh. &#8220;Not I. It is not
an uncommon device. I fancy even Scotland Yard will
have some trouble in following up that clue. Thanks
for letting me see it, Duchess. I&#8217;m afraid I have rather
a taste for the morbid.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>She was evidently not going to get anything out of
him that would pay for the trouble of fetching the
<i>corpus delicti</i>, and so her Grace wrapped it up again in
no very amiable mood. Her visitor&#8217;s reticence was the
more exasperating in that her instinct told her he could,
if he chose, give a shrewd guess at the owner. Except
as a matter of feminine curiosity she did not care much
to know what she was convinced Playford might have
told her; but she did not consider it consistent with
her dignity to be thus made use of, and she felt very
much inclined to be rude to her departing guest. And
it is given to Duchesses to be very rude when they like.
Then a certain idea of the inexpediency of venting her
spleen occurred to her just in time; perhaps she realized
that Aubrey Playford was a dangerous man for even a
Duchess to snub, and she let him go in peace.</p>

<p>But the Duke, who dared not go out, remained to
her; and he went to bed that night feeling that the
world may be made very unpleasant, even for a Duke.</p>

<small>THE MAN WHO GUESSED</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">COUNTESS ALEXIA of Rohnburg had had a few
of her intimate friends to luncheon at the house
in Green Street, and the last of them, Mary Riverdale,
was still sitting with her in cosy chat when a note was
brought in. That her hostess did not like the look of
the handwriting on the envelope, Miss Riverdale was
sure. But she forbore the comment to which her intimacy
might have entitled her, and contented herself
with running through a picture book while Alexia read
the note.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is&mdash;any one waiting?&#8221; the Countess had asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, madame,&#8221; answered the man, unsatisfyingly
laconic, as became his position.</p>

<p>Alexia read the note, restored it to its envelope and
put it, address downwards, on the table. Her visitor
threw aside the <i>Graphic</i>, and for a few moments there
was a constrained silence, a pause of mental self-consciousness,
almost awkward, considering how intimate
the two were. But both of them, young though they
might be, were too experienced players in that everyday
game of social diplomacy to let an embarrassment
become manifest. Yet there will assert itself, in spite
of tact and artifice, a certain instinct which tells us our
companions are reading our thoughts and gauging our
dilemmas.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder what the next development of the Vaux<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
House mystery will be,&#8221; Miss Riverdale observed, quoting
the headline of the <i>Daily Comet</i>.</p>

<p>The affair had, as was natural, been the subject of
animated discussion at luncheon, and it seemed scarcely
worth while to reopen it.</p>

<p>The Countess gave a shrug. &#8220;We must wait and
see,&#8221; she answered mechanically. &#8220;The poor Duchess!
One almost feels one ought to leave cards of
enquiry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The poor Duke,&#8221; laughed her friend. &#8220;They will
get more fun out of him than ever. Not but what this
is a serious matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You really think so?&#8221; The talk was being sustained
by an effort on both sides, and Alexia&#8217;s question
sounded suspiciously like covering a yawn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you?&#8221; the other returned, in languid surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I suppose so. If it is all true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course if it isn&#8217;t true we shall have a disclaimer
from the Lancashires to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean the connection between the broken ornament,
the little sword, or whatever it is, and poor Captain
Martindale&#8217;s death. You knew him, Mary?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only by sight. You did, dear, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Casually. Meeting him about. As a matter of fact
I was to have danced with him at the very time he
was found dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Alix! You never told me that. How awful!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It might have been,&#8221; the Countess responded composedly.
&#8220;But I did not see him. It was late; a good
many people had gone. He did not come for his dance;
then there was a fuss: we were told, at least I was, that
Captain Martindale had had a fit, and people went off.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
I fancy most of the men knew the real state of the
case.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Riverdale gave a little shudder. &#8220;Horrible! At
a dance, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. It was upsetting, even to us who did not
know the truth. As we were going, a doctor bustled in,
shivering in a great-coat buttoned up to hide the fact
that he was only half dressed. I have often thought
that great-coat in the ball-room brought home the idea
of a tragedy more vividly than the sight of the dead man
could have done. Ugh! Don&#8217;t let&#8217;s talk about it any
more, or I shall get the blues.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her visitor rose. &#8220;You look, my dear Alix, as though
you had them already. Come across the Park with
me. I am going that way home; we are pretty sure
to meet some one to enliven us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alexia shook her head. &#8220;I was out all the morning
and am rather tired. I feel too dull even to ask you
to stay.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Riverdale scarcely needed a hint to see that she
had suddenly become <i>de trop</i>. She wondered whether
her hostess&#8217;s sudden preoccupation was not due to the
letter just received; but to wonder was all that was
permitted her.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the door closed upon her visitor when
Alexia took up the note and read it through again, and
this time there was no need for her to hide her disquietude.
The words were few.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Dear Countess</span>,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have something of great importance to say to
you; if you read the papers you will doubtless guess
to what I refer. Will you, in your own interest, be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
good enough to remove for once the embargo you have
laid on my visits, and be at home when I call at four
this afternoon?</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">&#8220;Yours sincerely,</span><br />

&#8220;<span class="smcap">Aubrey Playford</span>.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>She read it through twice, and as she did so, she
seemed to be struggling to evade the grip of a strong will
that lurked beneath the words. Then, mechanically,
she put the note back into its envelope and turned to
glance at the clock. It was nearly four. She hesitated
for a few moments, as taking counsel with herself; then
rang the bell.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am at home to Mr. Playford when he calls this
afternoon,&#8221; she told the man, giving the order with a
plain-spoken authority which disarmed all suspicion of
an impropriety.</p>

<p>She had not long to wait before the expected visitor
was announced.</p>

<p>Playford came in deferentially confident and inscrutable,
and as Alexia rose to receive him her eyes met
his boldly in a look of challenge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bring tea,&#8221; she said casually to the man as he left
the room. She was not going to indue this unwelcome
visit with any mysterious importance.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was good of you, Countess, to grant my request,&#8221;
Playford said, as he sat down, and let his eyes rest with
covetous admiration on the beautiful woman before him.
&#8220;I hope it has not been inconvenient; but the matter
on which it was necessary to see you was urgent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; she answered coolly. &#8220;I have had
some people to luncheon, and they have only just gone.
What did you want to tell me?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>&#8220;I gave you a hint, Countess, in my note.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please explain it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You did not understand it?&#8221; The tone was incredulous;
coupled with the sly look, almost offensively so.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not in the least,&#8221; Alexia returned simply, so directly
as to blunt the point of the insinuation.</p>

<p>But Playford was not the man to show a repulse.
&#8220;It is about this business at Vaux House,&#8221; he said,
with quiet incisiveness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh? What of that? How does it concern me?&#8221;</p>

<p>If she was playing a part, her skill called forth his
grudging admiration; grudging because he knew from
her tone that, except under duress, she was not for him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know, Countess,&#8221; he replied, speaking now with
forced directness; &#8220;you have seen that the little jewelled
sword, a hair ornament, with which Reggie Martindale
was killed, has been found?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she responded casually; &#8220;I saw that in the
paper.&#8221;</p>

<p>He told himself, as he watched her, that she had gone
a shade paler; that was all; and he could not be quite
certain of that.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you believe it?&#8221; she added, as he paused, so
to speak, on the strike.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is true enough,&#8221; he said, in a tone that took the
question out of the region of the debatable. &#8220;Reggie
Martindale was done to death that night; why&mdash;only
one person, probably, on this earth knows; but that he
did not die a natural death has all along been almost
an open secret.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Has it?&#8221; she observed simply, yet with the slightest
touch of contradiction. &#8220;Yes; well, I have heard
as much. Mr. Dormer Greetland was telling us a long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
story about it a day or two ago. Still, I don&#8217;t see how
it concerns me.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was better entrenched against his attack, he was
forced to admit, than he had thought to find her; still,
the defence should not serve.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid it does concern you, Countess, very
nearly,&#8221; he replied, in a tone dark with impending
mischief.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me how, Mr. Playford.&#8221;</p>

<p>He gave a slight bow, as accepting the challenge.
&#8220;I have seen this little weapon, the tiny sword; a
dangerous ornament, Countess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; There seemed little more than a half-amused
curiosity in her tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Duchess showed it to me, and&mdash;I recognized
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alexia laughed. &#8220;Ah, now I know. I think I have
guessed this mysterious piece of news. I suppose you
are going to say that you have recognized this formidable
ornament as belonging to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Manifestly he did not like the words being taken out
of his mouth, but he could only respond, with a slight
bow of assent, &#8220;You have guessed it, Countess.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed again. &#8220;My dear Mr. Playford, what
an absurd idea!&#8221; Any one would have thought from
her manner and his that she had him discomfited; but
Aubrey Playford was not the man to be so easily beaten
off.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hardly absurd, Countess.&#8221; That was all he could
say, for the door opened and tea was brought in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is the poor Duke very much upset?&#8221; Alexia enquired,
giving the necessary turn to the conversation
while the men were in the room.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>Playford gave an appropriately humorous answer as
to the ducal state of mind, all the while eyeing the girl
searchingly, and in spite of himself, inclined to wonder
whether, after all, he might not have made a mistake.</p>

<p>When they were alone once more, their talk did not
for the moment revert to its former and more dangerous
channel. Perhaps both were glad of an armistice
after the first trial of strength, of a short breathing
space now that the methods of attack and defence were
declared. Alexia poured out the two cups of tea, and
did not raise her eyes from the table until Playford
had taken his cup. Then she leaned back in her chair
and faced him boldly as ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;You come here to tell me that?&#8221;</p>

<p>His eyes were on her, alert as a fencer&#8217;s. &#8220;Could I
do otherwise?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely,&#8221; she returned, with something like contempt.
&#8220;Even if it were true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I have made a mistake, Countess.&#8221;
He spoke slowly with a staccato enunciation of the words.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have, Mr. Playford.&#8221; The cool incisiveness
of her tone stung him.</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; he asked, with an ugly look of fight in his
malicious eyes.</p>

<p>She was ready with her answer. &#8220;To begin with,
in coming here at all; to a house, I mean, where you
might know you would not be welcome.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Obviously,&#8221; he retorted with a smile, &#8220;as the bearer
of unwelcome news.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which, if true, would be no news.&#8221;</p>

<p>The hit was palpable, but he gave no sign that he
felt it. &#8220;I came to warn you,&#8221; he said, still watching
her darkly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>&#8220;It was very kind of you,&#8221; she returned, with a
touch of contemptuous irony, &#8220;and quite unnecessary.&#8221;</p>

<p>Manifestly the time for fencing was past. Playford
rose, ostensibly to put down his cup, but he remained
standing over her. &#8220;Countess,&#8221; he began, in a tone
that had a deeper vibration in it, &#8220;Alexia&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She raised her head imperiously. &#8220;Mr. Playford, I
have forbidden you to address me in that manner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; he assented. &#8220;And you have forbidden
me your house.&#8221;</p>

<p>She gave a little scornful nod of agreement.</p>

<p>&#8220;For no adequate reason,&#8221; he protested. &#8220;My presumption,
as no doubt you would call it&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Persecution,&#8221; she corrected.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not persecution,&#8221; he argued. &#8220;That is a hard
word to use towards a man whose love overmasters
him and makes him unduly importunate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A man,&#8221; she replied, and from her tone she might
have been discussing the point merely from an academical
point of view, &#8220;a man who cannot control his
feelings, but allows them to get the better of him to
the annoyance of others, deserves to be kept at a distance,
even as you have been.&#8221;</p>

<p>The last touch perceptibly stung him. There was an
unpleasant gleam in his eye as he returned, &#8220;But I
am determined my state of banishment from you shall
last no longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her dark eyes were raised in half-amused scorn.
&#8220;Indeed? I think that rests with me rather than with
you, Mr. Playford.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It did,&#8221; he retorted viciously; &#8220;but it does no
longer.&#8221; He bent over her. &#8220;Alexia&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>She motioned him away, and rose. &#8220;No,&#8221; she said,
for the first time showing anger; &#8220;I will not allow you
to call me that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you will,&#8221; he returned. &#8220;Let us understand
one another.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you think there is any misapprehension,&#8221; she
said, now cold again; &#8220;there is none on my part.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think there is,&#8221; he rejoined significantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she maintained scornfully. &#8220;I can reckon
you up, Mr. Playford. I am sorry you should have
thought proper to come here to threaten me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have I?&#8221; he broke in protestingly. &#8220;Have I
threatened you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If not,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;I confess I do not see the
drift of what you have said.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In my own justification, let me tell you,&#8221; he
urged. &#8220;Please.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alexia resumed her seat with a significant glance
at the clock. &#8220;I hope it will not take you very
long.&#8221;</p>

<p>How he hated her, this scornful, imperious beauty,
who was meeting his attack so skilfully; hated her for
her contempt and rejection of him, yet loved her with
a fierceness and pervasiveness which he was, with all
his self-control, unable to subdue; while he hated and
cursed the bands of the passion that encompassed
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I certainly did not come here to threaten you,
Countess,&#8221; he began, in a tone schooled almost to
apology. &#8220;I should hardly have brought myself to
repay your graciousness in receiving me by an action
so ill as that. I have simply come here, led, driven by
an impulse which you forbid me to name, to make a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
proposition to you, or, if you prefer the word, a bargain
with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lying back in her low chair, her eyes fixed almost
dreamily upon the little gold pencil-case which she
lazily pushed in and out, she just lifted them for an
instant to Playford&#8217;s face, then lowered them again.
But from the light of that instant&#8217;s glance he saw no
encouragement.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is easy,&#8221; he went on, for the pause had been
but momentary, and Alexia showed no desire to interrupt
him, &#8220;it is easy to moralize and to propound codes
of so-called honour, but when a man is possessed by a
love as desperate, as all-absorbing as mine, he is scarcely
to be blamed if, while human nature remains as it is,
he seizes any advantage which fate may give him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Advantage?&#8221; she repeated thoughtfully. &#8220;You
say Fate has given you an advantage&mdash;over me?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was an infinity of suggestion, of latent disdain,
in the question.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let us put it that way, Countess,&#8221; he protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;The word was yours, not mine,&#8221; she returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;True. But the application was yours. Let us look
the situation squarely in the face,&#8221; he proceeded, anxious
now to come to the point, lest the interview should
be interrupted before he had declared himself. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
you think that, as you and I are, presumably, the only
people in the world who know your secret, we&mdash;we
might share more than that?&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused for her answer, but none came. Her attitude
suggested that she was waiting for him to go on
to the end, if it were not already reached.</p>

<p>&#8220;Countess!&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus called upon, she looked up.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>&#8220;With regard to your proposal,&#8221; she said, in quite a
matter-of-fact tone, &#8220;it has the disadvantage of being
based upon false premises.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You talk of my secret&mdash;dangerous secret, I think
you called it. I have no secret, dangerous or harmless,
that can be shared by you&mdash;or anything else.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took a step nearer and lowered his tone as he
replied, &#8220;This is absurd, Countess. You will not put
me off so. The little weapon with which Martindale
was killed belonged to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed?&#8221; She gave a laugh. &#8220;I do not admit
that for an instant; but, supposing it did, what then?&#8221;</p>

<p>He had scarcely expected this unwavering defence,
this absence of any sign of fear in her. He was bound
now to fight without compunction.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would, naturally, coupled with other circumstances,
raise a very ugly suspicion against you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What other circumstances?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you render it unnecessary for me to mention
them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By letting me be no longer out of favour with you,&#8221;
he pleaded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I prefer to hear the other circumstances.&#8221; She was
hatefully cold and contemptuous, he told himself; wishing
almost that he had not come on this errand which
promised him as little satisfaction as honour.</p>

<p>&#8220;You were in that little room with Martindale,&#8221;
he said, with an effort to save the situation. &#8220;You
were seen to come out of it not long before his death
was discovered.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Seen? By whom?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>&#8220;By me, for one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; There was infinite significance in the exclamation.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was known to be an admirer of yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I kill my admirers?&#8221; She rose. &#8220;You are
giving me a terrible, a really medi&aelig;val character,
Mr. Playford. I wonder you trusted yourself here
alone. But perhaps you left word with the police
before you ventured to knock at the door. Is there
anything more you have to say to me? It is getting
late.&#8221;</p>

<p>She had beaten him at every point, turned every
lunge he had thought to make with deadly effect. The
sting of her sarcasm made him furious; as furious as
a man of his self-contained temperament could ever
show himself to be.</p>

<p>He could hardly prolong the interview now, after
her unmistakable hint; and if he did, it must be with
little hope of gaining his point. She meant fighting,
if it were forced upon her, and, so far, her defence had
been perfect.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then do I understand you to deny, Countess, that
the little dagger is yours?&#8221; he asked bluntly, with an
expression of rankling defeat on his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know nothing of it,&#8221; she answered, with contemptuous
indifference; &#8220;and if I did, I should scarcely
be inclined, after your somewhat objectionable proposal,
to discuss the matter with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>As she made a move towards the bell, he put forth
a restraining hand. &#8220;Then you reject me and my suggestion,
Countess,&#8221; he demanded sullenly. &#8220;It is your
final answer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My final answer,&#8221; she assured him. &#8220;I am only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
sorry that you should have been so ill-advised as to
invite it.&#8221; And she rang the bell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; he returned darkly. &#8220;Time will show
which of us has been the more ill-advised.&#8221;</p>

<p>She had turned her back upon him, and so, without
any leave-taking, he went away.</p>

<small>THE MAN BEHIND</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;YOU are earlier than I expected, Geoffrey.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gastineau, as he spoke, laid down the book he
was reading and stretched out his hand to Herriard
with a smile. &#8220;Was the dinner worth going to&mdash;apart
from business?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes; it wasn&#8217;t bad.&#8221; Herriard brought up a
chair and sat down with a yawn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me all about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much to tell that would amuse you, I&#8217;m afraid.
The usual assemblage of self-seekers; I myself being no
exception.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Gastineau agreed, with a little cynical laugh
that seemed characteristic of the man. &#8220;It is inevitable,
as the world goes to-day. All tradesmen, advertising
their wares, only in our plane of life they
happen to be intellectual goods we want to dispose of.
There is not much point in being clever, Geof, unless
we bring samples of our brains into market and make
the world think the bulk is equal in quality all through.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In some, perhaps rare, cases it is,&#8221; Herriard observed.
&#8220;Yours, my dear friend, for instance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gastineau shook his head with a meaning smile.
&#8220;You didn&#8217;t know much of me in my living days. If
they were not over I would not tell you what a humbug
I was. Oh, yes,&#8221; he replied to the other&#8217;s gesture of
protest; &#8220;I had a certain amount of brains, more than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
most people, if you like; and that is not saying much.
But let me assure you, my dear Geof, that their principal
employment when I was fighting the world, was
in minimizing my defects and exaggerating my cleverness;
in short, working with all my might to make the world
take me for a wonderfully clever genius, and to ascribe
to abnormal brain-power what was really due to carefully
directed push and discriminating powers of showing
off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is difficult to believe,&#8221; Herriard returned with
mock gravity, &#8220;in face of the astounding modesty with
which you tell it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; Gastineau sighed wearily, with a strong
man&#8217;s check on despair. &#8220;It is all over now. No
more use in keeping on the mask: I can throw it off,
and be comfortable. Well, go on about the dinner.
The usual dozen and a half of snobs and fools, brave
women and fair men, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The majority certainly answered your description.
Lord and Lady Greystoke were there; he looking something
between a professional conjurer and an Italian
waiter, she like a faded doll left too long in the toy-shop
window and touched up for sale with a dab of vermilion
on each cheek.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes. I remember her years ago. She always
had that etiolated look.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder how Greystoke, with his taste for southern
colouring, came to marry her. He talked Italy all
dinner and was hovering about Sicily when I left.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She had eight thousand a year,&#8221; Gastineau explained,
&#8220;the depth of the gold at her bankers compensated
for the pale straw of her colouring. Whom
did you take in?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>&#8220;Mrs. Roderick Capel, a doll of another description.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, of the mechanical and talking variety.&#8221; Gastineau
laughed. &#8220;At least, she chattered.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About herself the whole time; with a perfect genius
for making a long sermon from an unpromising text
which must have stirred the admiration of the Dean of
Stanborough who was her other neighbour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, she has caught the disease egoitis in a virulent
form from her husband who was once a commercial
traveller,&#8221; Gastineau commented. &#8220;He used to travel
in millinery: he now travels in Roderick Capel, Esquire,
M.P. etc., etc., and with the same push that gave
him his first hundred pounds. I know the fellow; won
a big case for him about ten years ago. He was so
irrepressibly offensive that I nearly threw the brief
at his head. The only man I felt I could never snub.
Who else?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me see. Oh, the Tayntons.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Negligible quantities, except so far as the commisariat
is concerned. Lady Mary, a greedy monosyllabic
nonentity, and he a ventriloquist&#8217;s puppet, wooden, and
as symmetrical as a wax-work with a movable lower
jaw that looks as though it were worked by a string.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How ready people are to waste their hospitality on
titled lay figures,&#8221; Gastineau observed contemptuously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; Herriard continued, &#8220;there was Briscoe, the
new member for Wroxby, very pleased with himself;
a wig-block of a Guardsman invited probably for table-dressing
purposes; and a German doctor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Variety, at least.&#8221; Gastineau lay back with a
smile, watching Herriard with half-closed eyes. &#8220;What
was the German doctor doing there?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>&#8220;Come over here for some big operation, I heard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! What is his name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not catch it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; Gastineau&#8217;s eyes contracted curiously. &#8220;He
did not interest you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not particularly. Although he was probably the
most interesting person there. But he was not near
me; I had, when the ladies went, to endure the banal
egoism of my fellow M.P.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The social tax levied by stupidity on intellect.&#8221;
Gastineau roused himself again. &#8220;Ah, my dear Geoffrey,
we must not be impatient with fools and bores.
If every one were clever and interesting we should be
lost in the crowd. Now; the Rullington case. Is the
day fixed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is only five down the list,&#8221; Herriard answered,
taking some memoranda from his pocket. &#8220;One case
is a big one, but Dancer tells me there is a great possibility
of its being settled. So Rullington may come
on at any time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You found my notes for your speech clear, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite, thank you. I ought to do something there.
I only wish I could do justice to your ideas.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gastineau seemed rather darkly preoccupied. &#8220;Oh,
my dear fellow,&#8221; he replied, almost mechanically,
&#8220;you&#8217;ll do me and yourself justice enough if only you
make up your mind to it. Confidence, confidence is
the nine points of pleading.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the tenth?&#8221; Herriard laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is composed of equal parts of law and luck. You
ought to make a big hit here, Geof. It&#8217;s a fighting
case, if ever there was one; the sort of case where,
even with losing it a foregone conclusion, a man who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
can seize the chance is sure to send up his reputation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid of Lady Rullington.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind her, as long as you are not afraid of
yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She may break down under Maxwell&#8217;s cross-examination.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maxwell&#8217;s line of comity will naturally be to bully
her into damaging admissions; so much the better for
you. A better man for our purpose could not lead
against you. You can have the chivalrous stop out
all along, and make capital out of his treatment of your
witness. Do everything to get the sympathy, at least
of the public, with you, and fight, fight, fight; then,
whatever the result, you, Geoffrey Herriard, will score
heavily.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you know I am only too grateful to find a
means of utilizing what must otherwise now be a buried
talent. By the way, talking of <i>causes c&eacute;l&egrave;bres</i>, what is
the latest about the Vaux House affair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have heard of no further development.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course every one is talking about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a perfect conversational windfall.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope, for your sake, my dear boy, the Rullington
case will not come on till the Lancashire has talked
itself out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Herriard laughed. &#8220;It promises to do so, unless it
gets a second wind from some sensational development.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gastineau shook his head. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see much chance
of that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Herriard agreed. &#8220;Only the finding of the
owner of the discovered weapon.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>&#8220;Have you heard any rumour of that?&#8221; the question
came sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, nothing tangible,&#8221; Herriard answered. &#8220;Of
course, everybody thinks it necessary and smart to have
a theory.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And names are mentioned?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes. Half the smart women in town are pointed
at, many of whom were not even at the ball.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gastineau laughed confidently. &#8220;Then there is safety
in numbers&mdash;for the real culprit. Our old friend, no
doubt, the <i>spret&aelig; injuria form&aelig;</i> for motive. Well, let
us hope two things, one that for the lady&#8217;s sake it won&#8217;t
come out further, and, secondly, if it does, that Geoffrey
Herriard will be retained for the defence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be the trial of the century.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite. Thanks for coming in. Look here, by-the-bye,&#8221;
Gastineau reached to the table that stood by him,
and took up some pages of manuscript. &#8220;I have got
out a peroration for your speech in Rullington, supposing
it comes to that stage. I got my mind full of the
case, and I can&#8217;t help making speeches as I lie here.
I think it is rather taking, if I may say so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You need not say so, at any rate,&#8221; Herriard
laughed. &#8220;It would not be your speech if it wasn&#8217;t
effective.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, well, it is just the sort of thing that used to go
down with them. There&#8217;s your part.&#8221; He tossed the
papers towards Herriard. &#8220;Take it and learn it. And
now, good-night. By the way,&#8221; he added, with a half
yawn as Herriard pressed his hand and turned to go,
&#8220;you can&#8217;t recollect the name of the German medico
you met to-night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I don&#8217;t,&#8221; the other answered. &#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>&#8220;Oh, nothing. A sick man&#8217;s trivial curiosity, a failing
I never had time for when I lived in the busy world.
Good-night. <i>A demain.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>As the door closed upon Herriard, a strange look of
suspicion had come over Gastineau&#8217;s face.</p>

<small>THE FIERY ORDEAL</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BEFORE many days had passed Countess Alexia
had reason to know that the enemy she had made
and defied was at work against her. Her instinctive
judgment of her unwelcome admirer&#8217;s character had
surely prepared her for this. And in truth Aubrey
Playford was one of those men whose chivalry is but
skin-deep: it is merely the veneer of their education
and breeding, the mask which covers a malignant and
unscrupulous soul. The man could be trusted to act
according to the recognized codes of honour and propriety
so long as his own interest and feelings were not
deeply touched; when passion, developing into a spirit
of vindictiveness, clashed with the code, the mask
shrivelled away and the real man showed his face.</p>

<p>But in this matter he had worked quietly, unostentatiously,
knowing well how small a spark of scandal it
takes to kindle a great fire. It had been enough for
him to drop a few well-placed hints, of course under a
strict and purposely futile enjoinment to secrecy, and
the mischief was done. The whispers spread, growing
in tone and freedom, till at last Countess Alexia von
Rohnburg began to be openly pointed at in serious
connection with the Vaux House tragedy. From personal
to journalistic accusation was but a step and that
an inevitable one. The allusions to a young lady of
great beauty, a well-known and popular figure in society,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
closely connected with the diplomatic world, were
markedly obvious, and the question was discussed, under
a thinly veiled indication of identity, whether, being
protected by the law governing foreign embassies, she
would be amenable to justice were the crime brought
home to her.</p>

<p>So, it seemed, in a few hours, Countess Alexia was
rudely made aware of the fact that she was a marked
woman. All kinds of wild tales began to be circulated
as to the motive for the deed; there was a strong touch
of romance about it that caught the popular fancy; the
affair was lifted by its surroundings from the normal
sordid groove of crime; yet the fact, the terrible fact,
remained that this girl was pointed at as a murderess.</p>

<p>Merely on suspicion, it is true, but suspicion, the very
vaguest, left to roam unchecked, gathers size and weight
till it assumes the proportions of certainty.</p>

<p>When the odious innuendo first came to Count Prosper&#8217;s
notice he went to his sister in a terrible state of
mind. He was, for a diplomatist, a frank, straightforward
young fellow, devoted to his profession, and
jealous of his family honour. Alexia assured him that
the suspicion was, if not quite groundless, absolutely
untrue.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we must give it the lie at once,&#8221; he cried,
with the vehemence of his native blood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would it not be wiser to treat it with contempt?&#8221;
she argued. &#8220;There is nothing tangible yet to answer,
and there is the unfortunate fact to face that I was
in the room with Captain Martindale, and I did lose,
there or somewhere else, my sword hair-pin.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stared at her blankly for some seconds before he
could reply. There was a terrible suspicion in his mind.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>&#8220;Alix,&#8221; he exclaimed hoarsely, &#8220;you&mdash;you didn&#8217;t kill
him?&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed. &#8220;No, my dear Prosper,&#8221; she answered,
meeting his look frankly; &#8220;I give you my word of
honour I am as innocent of that as yourself. Although
the man did behave somewhat objectionably.&#8221;</p>

<p>Count Prosper gave a great sigh of relief. &#8220;Thank
Heaven!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;I thought for a moment it
might have been true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear brother,&#8221; she protested, &#8220;I admit your
right to ask the question, but really you might credit
me with a less drastic but hardly less effective method
of giving aggressive admirers their quietus. Poor Captain
Martindale! He was very confident in his powers
of fascination, but his vanity scarcely deserved that
punishment.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her brother had become calmer to face the situation.
&#8220;Then do you know anything about the mystery?&#8221;
he demanded. &#8220;Can you throw any light upon what
happened? It never occurred to me to ask you that
before, Alix; but if you know the real culprit, it is no
time to keep silence now that this fearful odium rests
on you. You will tell me?&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head. &#8220;I know nothing. I left Captain
Martindale in that little room alive and well; objectionably
so, I fear I thought him. And that was the
last I saw of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He, Martindale, made love to you?&#8221; Prosper asked,
after a troubled pause.</p>

<p>Alexia gave a shrug. &#8220;He made love to every
woman worth making love to. Yes, he included me
in his score. Unfortunately I was obliged by an act
of friendship to give him the opportunity.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>&#8220;Ah, yes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know Hilda Dainton? He was inclined to behave
very badly to her. Some men cannot bear to
think that there is any happiness left in store for their
cast-off loves. Hilda had made a fool of herself, and
repented&mdash;too soon, I fancy, and Captain Martindale,
when he found his power over her slipping away, tried to
make use of another hold over her; some stupid letters.&#8221;</p>

<p>Prosper nodded. &#8220;I see, Alix. You could help her
when she could not help herself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I considered anything fair with such a man,&#8221; Alexia
replied simply. &#8220;One must fight unscrupulous deceivers
with their own weapons. The man made love to
me and there was my opportunity. At the price of a
kiss I got Hilda&#8217;s letters back for her, and in return
presented Captain Martindale with my opinion of his
conduct. That was all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish it were all, Alix,&#8221; her brother said gravely.
&#8220;At present it looks as though we were at the beginning
of an ugly scandal; none the less ugly that it is untrue.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry, Prosper,&#8221; Alexia replied. &#8220;But what
can I do? I cannot marry a man I detest even to avoid
the most hideous of scandals.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her brother started. &#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Simply,&#8221; she answered with a shrug, &#8220;that we owe
this to Mr. Aubrey Playford.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That fellow? Ah, yes; you forbade him the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was necessary,&#8221; Alexia said coldly. &#8220;When
people forget themselves, they can scarcely complain
if the rest of the world shows a disposition to consign
them to oblivion. But he came here the other day
and confirmed my opinion of him by giving me my
choice between this scandal and himself.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>Prosper began to pace the room impatiently. &#8220;It
is unfortunate, Alix,&#8221; he remarked somewhat querulously,
&#8220;that you seem fated to fascinate the wrong
men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It carries a sufficient punishment with it, my dear
Prosper,&#8221; she returned. &#8220;You need not add your
reproaches.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The veering of scandal&#8217;s vane had afforded considerable
relief to the Duke and Duchess of Lancashire.
His Grace found that he could walk the streets once
more and enter his clubs without the inconvenience of
feeling himself a marked man; and the Duchess, resuming
her social activities, rejoiced in discussing the affair
almost from an outsider&#8217;s standpoint.</p>

<p>Dormer Greetland was disposed to be very jocular on
the subject.</p>

<p>&#8220;The poor Duke,&#8221; he said, &#8220;is going about like a
convict on ticket-of-leave. He has been serving his
time with the Duchess, and a very uncomfortable time
it has evidently been. They say she has taken the
unique opportunity of wigging the poor man for every
act of his somewhat monotonous career. According to
her he has never done anything right in all his life,
except marrying her, and even there she has never
forgiven him for not being a more interesting bridegroom.
The wretched Duke, who can&#8217;t help his personality,
was brought up to rely upon his strawberry
leaves, and in the faith of the gospel that a Duke need
not bother about intellect or even appearance. For
the last ten years he has been enduring the process of
having all that nonsense shaken out of him, and the
Duchess can put plenty of vim into her shaking. Yes;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
this affair has afforded an excellent opportunity for
summing up the evidence against him, and he has been
found guilty on every count of the indictment. He
has had a pretty bad time of it. He could only plead
his dukedom, but he could hardly expect that to go
down with his partner in it, who was at once judge
and prosecuting counsel. They say things got so bad
that he had to lock himself up in his own rooms and
subsist on a stray tin of biscuits, a miscellaneous assortment
of tabloids, and a syphon of soda-water flavoured
with bay rum. The regimen has had such a lowering
effect on his constitution that he is more ducal than
ever. He is so fine-drawn, what with his troubles matrimonial
and commissariat, that Percy Nayland as he
saw him go into the Carlton said he looked like the
ghost of the Feudal System in a frock-coat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And in the meantime, what is going to be done
about the business?&#8221; some one asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;So far as I can make out,&#8221; the quidnunc answered,
&#8220;it is going to be left to develop.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Scotland Yard going to take it up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how they can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not against Countess Alexia von Rohnburg?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Monty,&#8221; Greetland returned, &#8220;as things
stand, they can&#8217;t do it. They have nothing to go upon.
You must remember, what the public never will understand,
that moral proof does not necessarily constitute
legal evidence. Granted that this ornamental stiletto,
which has been found, belonged to the Countess, also
that she and Reggie Martindale were together alone in
the room not long before the tragedy was discovered,
it establishes a <i>prim&acirc; facie</i> case against her, but, so far,
nothing more.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>&#8220;Circumstantial evidence, surely?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but with an important link missing from the
chain. You see a good deal might have occurred between
the moment of the Countess Alexia&#8217;s leaving the
room and the finding of what happened. No, my dear
friends, it looks very like what we all think it, but
there is an important section of the affair still covered
in mystery.&#8221;</p>

<p>Greetland had made it his business to work up the
subject; it was his vocation to be glib and authoritative
on every likely topic of the day.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Countess&#8217;s position is not exactly enviable,&#8221; a
man suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is utterly and entirely odious,&#8221; Greetland agreed.
&#8220;One scarcely likes to believe the thing of her; she is
such a charming girl. Yes; one is horribly sorry for
her. Without forgetting the dictum <i>de mortois</i>, one may
hazard the opinion that poor Reggie probably brought
the thing on himself and got no more than he deserved.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m!&#8221; There was a general pursing of lips as of
men who felt constrained to keep silence when it was
in their minds to say much. Restraint, however, was
not a virtue which either character or inclination encouraged
Greetland to practise. &#8220;There was that affair
of Annabel Fancourt,&#8221; he remarked, in a low tone,
as of those who discuss the dead in their coffined
presence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Behaved badly there, eh?&#8221; a man suggested, feeling
his way carefully along the fascinating path of
scandal which leads directly away from the above-mentioned
dictum.</p>

<p>Greetland shook his head with a suggestion of unutterable
condemnation.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>&#8220;Ah; always understood so,&#8221; the other man proceeded,
gaming boldness since no one seemed inclined
to protest. After all, it is often quite as piquant to
discuss the sins of the dead as of the living, and actually
does less harm&mdash;to them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather a bad lot,&#8221; another ventured.</p>

<p>&#8220;Always might be calculated on to go crooked with
women,&#8221; the fourth gossip supplemented.</p>

<p>&#8220;They always spoilt him. Injudicious blandishment
has sent many a good man wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Women,&#8221; said Monty Vaxton who cultivated a reputation
as a social philosopher, &#8220;women can&#8217;t resist a
gamble in love. That is why the professional Philander
always has his hands, or rather his arms, full.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At any rate they are optimists in the passion,&#8221;
Jack Bellairs remarked, &#8220;and they think they can succeed
where other women have failed; quite forgetting
that they are playing for an elusive stake, and where
winning is, if possible, more disastrous than losing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you think,&#8221; said Hugh Lufton, who understood
facts better than theories, turning to Greetland, &#8220;that
Countess Alexia was under the influence of Martindale&#8217;s
fascinations?&#8221;</p>

<p>Greetland shrugged. &#8220;It looks like it; though no
one even suspected it. But she is a clever girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Scarcely, if that were the case,&#8221; Vaxton objected.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Monty,&#8221; said the drawing-room sage, &#8220;no
woman is clever in love, although many are perfect
geniuses in the matter of marriage. When we talk
of a clever woman we eliminate love from the question.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a strange aftermath of&mdash;I suppose&mdash;jealousy.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>&#8220;Yes; one hardly sees at this stage what the girl can
do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Awkward for Count Prosper,&#8221; Lufton declared.
&#8220;He is a very good fellow. For all practical purposes
an Englishman.&#8221; Which was the highest compliment
the speaker felt he could pay the young diplomat; and
certainly the sincerest.</p>

<p>&#8220;You remember,&#8221; Lufton said to Bellairs, &#8220;that
fellow Paul Gastineau, the K.C.?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gastineau? Rather. Killed in a railway accident
in Spain. I know what you are going to say. Yes.
He was supposed to be a great admirer of Countess
Alexia.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; Greetland replied, with the superiority
conferred by an acknowledged omniscience. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
fancy there was much in that, though. At any rate
on the lady&#8217;s side.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, no. He was a deuced clever fellow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gastineau? I should think so. He had about the
biggest practice at the Common Law Bar.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Safe for the Woolsack if he hadn&#8217;t been cut off.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lufton looked knowingly doubtful. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221;
he replied, with a contradictory head-shake. &#8220;Paul
Gastineau was not altogether a <i>persona grata</i>, clever as
he admittedly was. There seemed always something
about the fellow that put one on one&#8217;s guard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Too clever, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. One of those men whom even their own party
is afraid of. In politics safe mediocrities are preferred
to dangerous geniuses. And men of the Gastineau type
are looked upon with particular suspicion. They are
apt by comparison to show up the short-comings of
our pet aristocratic statesmen. No; I very much doubt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
whether that Spanish signalman&#8217;s error really robbed
England of a future Lord Chancellor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I dare say not,&#8221; Vaxton agreed musingly. &#8220;I am
inclined to think, though, that this man Herriard, who
has made such a hit in the Rullington case, will go
far. His style is like, very curiously like, Gastineau&#8217;s,
but without that touch of deviltry the other man often
exhibited. Yes; a safer man, and a more British personality.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gastineau was more or less a foreigner, wasn&#8217;t
he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Half Italian. Charlie Wryton who devilled him
told me he never quite felt at his ease with the fellow.
You know Wryton? Big man who got his blue at Oxford,
and the last man in the world, one would think,
to funk; but I really believe he was afraid, personally
afraid, of Gastineau, and distinctly relieved when he
was killed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The power of mind over matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather the influence of unscrupulousness on mere
animal courage. Gastineau&#8217;s mind and methods were
deeper than Charlie could fathom. There is always a
terror in the unknown.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Countess Alexia does not seem to have been particularly
happy in her lovers,&#8221; Bellairs remarked.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Greetland replied. &#8220;She is rather a mystery
in that way. I mean, that she was not married long
ago. Perhaps her unfortunate experiences may account
for it. But unhappily, a woman like that is bound to
attract the wrong sort of men as well as the right.
Anyhow, she has been clever enough to hold them at
bay. She could hardly have foreseen the Martindale
development.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>&#8220;Can any one, who knows anything of her, really
believe she killed him?&#8221; Lufton asked incredulously.</p>

<p>Greetland did not care to scotch a profitable scandal.
&#8220;Women are unaccountable creatures,&#8221; he replied,
with a shrug.</p>

<small>THE VAUX HOUSE CASE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE Rullington case had come on, had dragged
its ugly length through twenty sensational columns
of print, and had ended with honours&mdash;or, rather,
dishonours&mdash;easy. Incidentally, it sent Geoffrey Herriard
several rungs up the ladder of success. His
position now was enviable and seemed assured, thanks
to the strong, acute brain which backed him. It was,
perhaps, a cynical pleasure to Gastineau, lying helpless,
to feel that, nevertheless, he was not entirely impotent,
to strike vicious blows from behind his living mask; to
make his personality still felt in a world to which it was
dead. The lust for fighting still burned fiercely within
him; he could indulge it, and grimly watch the effect
of his tactics, his cunning lunges, his deft parries. Perhaps,
too, there was a certain joy in holding a man&#8217;s
career and reputation in the hollow of his hand. Herriard
was an apt pupil; still, he was, after all, but a
pupil. The clear grasp of the case or of a situation,
the piercing, unerring insight into the legal and political
complications, above all, the gift of forecasting probable
developments, all these were not to be acquired: they
could only be communicated from master to pupil as
occasion arose. Herriard, with Gastineau&#8217;s guidance
withdrawn, would have been left a man of fluency, of
reputation, but with no administrative power behind
them; one who would probably fail at a crisis, who at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
the parting of the ways would be as likely to take the
wrong road as the right. Each man knew this, and
each wondered at times whether the other knew it.
Certainly Herriard never showed the slightest suggestion
that he could get on without his mentor. On the
contrary, now that his reputation at the Bar seemed
established, he was just as assiduous as ever in paying
his evening visits to the secluded house in Mayfair for
instruction in the next day&#8217;s procedure. And Gastineau,
on his part, never seemed to weary of taking his
friend at great pains through the minutest convolutions
and ramifications of his work. It was like an old chess-player
instructing a prentice hand in the analysis of
openings, moves, and counter-moves, of attack and
defence.</p>

<p>But one day a strange thing happened. At the rising
of the Courts a knotty legal point which had been
sprung upon Herriard by the opening counsel remained
undecided. Herriard was going to speak in the House
that night, and so, being rather nonplussed by the point
of law, and not knowing when he might get away from
the division, he jumped into a hansom and drove off
to Mayfair with the intention of putting the point to
Gastineau while the arguments were still fresh in his
mind, and so being put up to a telling reply.</p>

<p>To his surprise, and for the first time during their
acquaintance, Gastineau was denied to him. The bolt
of the latch was shot, and his key would not turn it.
He rang, and Gastineau&#8217;s man, Hencher, who opened the
door, said, with a manner of significant insistence, that
his master could not see Mr. Herriard that afternoon.</p>

<p>Herriard stared. Such a reception was the last thing
he would have looked for.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>&#8220;Is anything the matter?&#8221; he enquired anxiously.
&#8220;Mr. Murray is not ill, not worse?&#8221;</p>

<p>Yes; Hencher thought, his master was ill, at least
he was in great pain. He could not bring himself to
see any one just then; and hoped, if Mr. Herriard called,
he would make allowances and forgive him.</p>

<p>There was no more to be said. The impulse of
friendship and gratitude had at first prompted Herriard
to go up and see whether he could be of any use or
comfort in alleviating the stricken man&#8217;s sufferings, but
Hencher stood uncompromisingly in the aperture of
the half-opened door, and made no suggestion of admitting
him. So Herriard, with a sympathetic message
for his friend, turned away, puzzled and a little hurt.
Pain? It was curious. Since the accident which crippled
him he had never heard Gastineau complain of
pain. His state had been one of sheer helplessness and,
so far as his lower limbs were concerned, of complete
insensibility. Then, even if Gastineau were in pain,
why had he refused to see the man who obviously was
his only friend? He could not understand it. Had
Gastineau&#8217;s feelings changed towards him? He could
think of no reason why that should be. The incident
worried and depressed him more than he cared to own;
anyhow, though, he would return that night when the
House was up, and then doubtless would know the
reason of that strange denial.</p>

<p>When at a late hour he drove up, the lock which he
had half expected to find secured against him, yielded
to his key, and Gastineau received him with all his usual
suggestion of warmth, and with a laughing apology for
what had happened in the afternoon. &#8220;But really, my
dear Geof, I was not fit to receive a dog, let alone my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
best friend, my only friend. I can&#8217;t forget that, you
know,&#8221; he added, with a fascinating touch of feeling;
&#8220;and simply dreaded lest my pain might have driven
me to an impatience, even with you, which might have
cast a shadow between us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Herriard could scarcely feel aggrieved after that.
Nevertheless two circumstances brought an uncomfortable
shadow of doubt to his mind. One was the unusual
symptoms of pain, of which he had never heard
Gastineau complain before; the other was that, instead
of, as he expected, finding his friend ill and exhausted
from the afternoon&#8217;s attack, he seemed brighter and
less helpless than usual. Still, Herriard told himself,
he knew little of medical science, had no experience in
the strange turns disease would take, and his doubts
therefore might be groundless.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what news?&#8221; Gastineau asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather good news,&#8221; Herriard answered. &#8220;I have
got a provisional retainer from Bowyers for a big case.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that?&#8221; Gastineau enquired alertly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing less than this Vaux House affair. I&#8217;m in
luck. That will be a sensational case, if you like.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think so,&#8221; Gastineau replied, a peculiar
gleam in his eyes contradicting the almost languid interest
in his manner. &#8220;What is the case? Is the Duke
bringing an action?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Duke? No. Countess Alexia of Rohnburg is
suing the <i>Daily Comet</i> for libel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! Yes; I anticipated that. The position has
been forced upon her. The innuendoes were unmistakable.
It is an ugly position for her, though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Particularly, if, as Bowyer assures me, she is absolutely
innocent in the matter.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>&#8220;So? He says that. And believes it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, from his manner. The Countess is the
victim, it appears, of a suspicion, coloured, unfortunately,
by unlucky coincidences.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m! She is bound to make an effort to put herself
right, even by challenging the <i>Daily Comet</i> to a legal
duel, poor woman,&#8221; Gastineau commented thoughtfully,
as he seemed to weigh the Countess&#8217;s chances in the professional
balance. &#8220;You are, of course, briefed for
her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; it is a fine opportunity for us&mdash;eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You could not wish for a better. You know the
Countess?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have met her and her brother, but don&#8217;t know
much of them. They seemed very much liked and
quite popular&mdash;but, of course, Gastineau, you must
have known them. They have been over here a good
many years now.&#8221;</p>

<p>The grey eyes from the couch shot a cross-examiner&#8217;s
glance at Herriard; then reassumed their former expression
of quietly alert interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; Gastineau answered, &#8220;I knew something
of them in the old days in my earlier state of existence.
It all seems so long ago, my former acquaintances are
like the figures in a dream. Yes,&#8221; he continued reminiscently;
&#8220;I recollect the Countess, a handsome, fair
girl with a beautiful voice, and more character in her
than one usually associates with those of her complexion.
And the brother? Yes; more like an Englishman than
a foreigner, with a taste for sport, natural rather than
acquired; a man whom one would trust to play the
game. Well, let&#8217;s hope he&#8217;ll win it this time. We
will do our best, eh, Geof?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>&#8220;I hope we shall,&#8221; Herriard answered heartily, adding,
&#8220;Your help will be very necessary here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, my dear boy, you shall have the best I
can give you. Although it strikes me you can almost
run alone now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not I,&#8221; Herriard protested, wondering whether he
detected a note of unwillingness in the other&#8217;s speech.
&#8220;Some cases, naturally, are plain sailing, and I have
gained experience and profited immensely under your
guidance; but here, I am sure, I should be utterly at
sea without you. It will be a terribly delicate case to
handle, and the slightest mistake in tactics may make
all the difference.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt,&#8221; Gastineau agreed. &#8220;Yet practically the
<i>onus probandi</i> will be on the other side. If the Countess
has nothing to fear from cross-examination, you ought
not to have a very difficult task in getting a verdict.
Always supposing, as I say, that she is keeping nothing
back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bowyer is positive. She has at any rate convinced
him. And he is no fool.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, old John Bowyer can see farther into a client&#8217;s
mind than most of his sort. Well, we shall see. Only
don&#8217;t forget, my dear Geof, that a presumably innocent
woman, with as fair and frank an appearance
as this Countess Alexia, can be deeper than you
and I and all the tribe of Bowyers put together. I
am thinking,&#8221; he added quickly, &#8220;of your reputation.
It would be bad for it if you made a mistake
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Under your auspices I don&#8217;t think I shall. It looks
like being the case of the century. Fancy the Duke
in the box under fire from Macvee.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>&#8220;The other side have him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So Bowyer thought. The Duke will have a bad
quarter of an hour on the subject of the hushing up of
the result of the post-mortem.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lucky for Blaydon that he is dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. He has escaped his Nemesis.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the only way to escape our Nemesis,&#8221; Gastineau
returned meaningly.</p>

<small>ALEXIA&#8217;S DENIAL</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SUDDENLY it became known that the venue of
the sensational Vaux House case was to be changed
from a civil to a criminal court. The reasons for this
were obvious. The one meant a summary trial, the
other involved vexatious delays which, considering the
very odious position in which Countess Alexia was
placed by the scandal, were not to be endured. Then
the alleged libel was, if unjustified, of a particularly
cruel and damning character; and so it was not a question
of damages but of punishment. Perhaps the writers
who had been so quick to jump at conclusions, and,
when seized upon, to elaborate doubtful facts into flamingly
sensational &#8220;copy,&#8221; began to share with the editors
who accepted them, certain misgivings that they
had asserted more than they could prove. They had
been unfortunately precipitate; still they must make a
stiff fight in justification, and at the worst there was
always a grand advertisement to be sure of.</p>

<p>So it came to pass that the responsible editors of the
<i>Daily Comet</i> and the <i>Mayfair Gazette</i> were cited to appear
at the Police Court to answer charges of criminal libel
at the instance of Countess Alexia von Rohnburg.</p>

<p>All the quidnuncs were there; all, that is, who could
squeeze into the Court. And a society tatler, a professional
diner-out, will take as much pains &#8220;to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
there,&#8221; and show himself as resourceful in expedients
for getting a good view as will the most enterprising
of journalists. And as the magisterial examination
dragged on, the sensation hunters had a series of highly
enjoyable field days.</p>

<p>The publication of the libels having been admitted
and justification pleaded, Countess Alexia was called
to give a direct denial to the charges insinuated against
her. Then came what was expected to be the feature
of the case, her cross-examination. The somewhat aggressive
methods of that celebrated legal bully, Ambrose
Macvee, K.C., failed to elicit any more damaging admission
than that she had lost her hair ornament at
the ball, and that to the best of her belief the one produced
in Court with which it was practically certain
Captain Martindale had been stabbed to death was that
which had belonged to her. This looked ugly enough,
especially when coupled with the admitted fact that
she had been alone with Captain Martindale in the little
room where he was subsequently found dead. Proof,
it is true, was forthcoming that the Countess had left
the room a considerable time before the tragedy was
discovered: she had danced with more than one partner,
and had betrayed no sign of confusion or excitement.</p>

<p>&#8220;What nerve the woman must have!&#8221; was the comment
of those who were loth to let go the sustaining
belief in her guilt to which they were clinging. It was
quite thrilling, and gave a new fillip to the sensation.
A Countess stabs her inconvenient lover to death in a
secluded corner, then returns to the ball-room and resumes
her waltzing as though nothing had happened.
What a pity that it was, so far, no more than conjecture.
However, merely in the way of suggestion, it furnished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
stimulating head-lines, somewhat carefully worded, it
is true; the penalty of libel and contempt of court being
very much in the air just then.</p>

<p>There was still, as there always had been, an important
link wanting in the chain of evidence which could
justify the charges against Countess Alexia, the mystery
of that half-hour during which the deceased man had
been left alone in that room, for anything to the contrary
that mortal eye had seen. Alexia swore that when
she left him he was alive, she had had a disagreement
with him on a rather painful subject, the reputation of
a friend of hers, and had parted with him on bad terms,
but she had never raised her hand against him. There
had been no reason why she should have done so: when
she quitted the room Captain Martindale was as much
alive as any one in that Court.</p>

<p>Of course she would swear that, the quidnuncs declared,
unless she wished to brand herself a murderess;
she had come into Court to swear to her innocence;
nothing less was to be expected. But it all looked very
queer, very ugly: at any moment, it was thought, she
might break down in her evidence, and the case be
brought to a sudden and dramatic close.</p>

<p>But Alexia never faltered, and then the disappointed
folk attributed this to her tremendous nerve-power.
The woman who could kill one lover and then go and
dance with another was not the sort of person to break
down in the witness-box. It was not to be expected,
even under Macvee&#8217;s searching and tricky cross-examination;
it simply emphasized her character, and consequently
her guilt. So much for the fashionable
Ghouls; the smart thirsters for blood.</p>

<p>But there was another party, smaller and less noisily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
insistent, who believed in Alexia; who looked upon her
as a high-spirited woman shamefully maligned and accused,
the victim as much of a terrible chain of coincidence
as of a hateful lust for scandal.</p>

<p>In his defence of the Countess, Herriard had, as both
he and Gastineau anticipated, a trying task. It required
the greatest delicacy and tact during the somewhat
drastic cross-examination of his client, to know
just when to interfere and how far to protest. In this
Gastineau&#8217;s advice was golden; he seemed to have the
faculty of anticipating everything that would happen;
not merely the line the cross-examination would take,
but even the very wording of the questions which the
rough-tongued Macvee would ask. So Herriard&#8217;s championship
of his client was, at least on the human side of
the case, successful to admiration, notwithstanding that
sympathy was largely against him. The craving for
scandal and for the downfall of a fair woman is a morbid
growth which will eat away the innate sense of chivalry.
Fair play is, paradoxically, often a sad spoil-sport: we
do not always want the best man to win, and right is
usually terribly uninteresting compared with wrong. So
there is much satisfaction in seeing wrong established
that the spectators may gloat over its punishment.
Still, Geoffrey Herriard&#8217;s advocacy, plucky yet tactful,
was bound to extort approval even from those who were
longing to see him trip; it had the unbounded praise of
the Countess&#8217;s sympathizers and, what he felt he valued
still more, the ardent gratitude of Alexia herself. Alexia
was, almost literally, fighting for her life; this hideous
chance threatened her with, at least, social annihilation,
and the very desperation of the fight accentuated her
dependence on her defender. Those were terrible days<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
to her, when she was a marked woman, the gazing-stock
for every vulgar quidnunc; branded already by the prejudice
of the sensation-mongers as, at least, a venial
murderess. The words and messages of sympathy she
constantly received scarcely sustained her through the
ordeal.</p>

<p>The Duke of Lancashire also was having a very uncomfortable
time of it. The suppression of the result
of Dr. Blaydon&#8217;s post-mortem examination was an awkward
point for him to meet. He was closely questioned
on the incident, and it is to be feared that the ducal conscience
went to bed that night with the weight of a certain
ugly sin called perjury upon it. For though his
Grace was fain to admit that he had given the obsequious
medico a substantial cheque to write a certificate of natural
death so that the fuss of an inquest might be
avoided, he yet stoutly denied all knowledge of the
wound, the pin-prick which had just reached that false
heart, and stopped its mechanism. Denial here was
safe, since the only other person who had absolute knowledge
of the transaction, namely the doctor himself, had
been summoned to another Bar where perjury is futile.</p>

<p>Still, although he stuck to his repudiation of the suggestion&mdash;since
its admission would have had serious consequences,
even for a Duke&mdash;his dignity was badly battered
about during that searching hour. He rather
attempted to take the line that he was too big a personage
to be expected to trouble himself about such unpleasant
trifles as the mysterious death of a guest under
his roof: he was accustomed to leave all these dismal,
disagreeable details to his people who would naturally
understand better than he how to deal with them. This
is the line for an aristocratic witness to take when he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
is to be the joy of the opposing counsel and the despair
of his own. The work of cutting away the fringe of
pomp and artificial grandeur, and holding up the poor
man inside them as a wretched specimen of weak-minded
humanity, is easy and paying.</p>

<p>The harried Duke, stripped for the hour, of his fine
feathers, made to stand out in a dingy, uncompromising
court, and show what manner of man he really was,
cut a sorry figure. Counsel poked fun at his pomposity,
his affectation of high and mighty indifference; there
was much laughter in court, and the whole deplorable
business was given verbatim (parentheses and all) in
the papers.</p>

<p>The case, when it at last reached the committal stage,
was left hanging in an evenly balanced position, and
public opinion was divided, although not quite so evenly,
as to the merits of the issue.</p>

<small>A SENSATIONAL APPEARANCE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ONE night, during the interval which fell between
the magisterial proceedings and the trial proper,
when the judgment of the law was yet suspended, while
that of public opinion was clamorously divided, Herriard
came hurrying to the house in Mayfair with a startling
piece of news.</p>

<p>It was no less than the unexpected acquisition of
evidence which seemed as though it must at a stroke
establish Countess Alexia&#8217;s innocence of the death of
Captain Martindale.</p>

<p>&#8220;A man has suddenly appeared,&#8221; Herriard related,
&#8220;turned up to-day at Bowyer&#8217;s office, who declares that
at about 12.30 on the night in question he was walking
down Verney Street, and as he passed under the wall
of Vaux House he stopped at the west gates to listen
to the music which, with the windows open, could be
plainly heard. That, as he waited there, his attention
was attracted by the sight of a man, evidently one of
the guests, who came out upon a low balcony, and,
having looked about as though to make sure he was not
observed, climbed over the railing and jumped down
into the garden. Campion says he then lost sight of
the man for a few minutes, but as he stayed on there
thinking little of the matter, the man suddenly reappeared,
hurried past the gate and came out by the wall
door, and then made off quickly towards Piccadilly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
Acting upon that evidence young Bowyer immediately
set off with Campion to Vaux House. The fellow described
exactly where he had stood and pointed out the
window through which the man appeared. It was&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; Gastineau interrupted, with his enigmatic
smile, &#8220;the very window of the room in which
Martindale was found dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly. What do you think of that, my dear
friend?&#8221;</p>

<p>He was looking eagerly at Gastineau for evidence of
his story&#8217;s effect; but from the depths of those inscrutable
eyes he could draw no certain conclusion. There
had been the alert, piercing glitter fastened on him as
he told the news, but, beyond a certain almost fierce
interest and enquiry, nothing was betrayed.</p>

<p>&#8220;A grand piece of evidence,&#8221; Gastineau now answered
quietly. &#8220;Almost too good, too conclusive, to be
true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The man is positive,&#8221; Herriard urged.</p>

<p>Gastineau nodded, as accepting the statement for what
it was worth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; he asked, &#8220;has he not come forward before?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has been abroad, in South America,&#8221; Herriard
explained, &#8220;and returned only a few days ago. The
possible connection of what he saw with Martindale&#8217;s
death occurred to him last night only, and he went
round to Bowyer&#8217;s the first thing this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; Gastineau&#8217;s lips were curled in a cynically
incredulous smile. &#8220;What is the position in life of this
Mr. Campion?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he is a respectable fellow enough,&#8221; Herriard
answered, a little dampened and set back by the other&#8217;s
questioning attitude. &#8220;A clerk. I should say a man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
of the middle class, ready to turn his hand to anything
decent.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gastineau&#8217;s smile broadened. &#8220;Including perjury?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Gastineau,&#8221; Herriard protested, &#8220;I don&#8217;t
think he is the man for that. I have just seen him at
my chambers, and did my best to test his story. He
seemed straightforward enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s hope so,&#8221; Gastineau returned dryly. &#8220;So he
went out to South America. To better his fortunes,
presumably. Has he done so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t fancy he has,&#8221; Herriard was forced to admit.</p>

<p>&#8220;You did not question him on that subject?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. We were too full of the more important one
of his evidence.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gastineau gave a little impatient head-shake. &#8220;My
dear Geof, I sometimes think I shall never teach you
to look at a case and a witness from the other side&#8217;s
point of view. Now, which do you suppose Macvee, or
any counsel with a head on his shoulders, would go for
in this case, the evidence or the man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The man, no doubt, seeing that his evidence, as we
take it, can scarcely be shaken. It does not, however,
necessarily follow that poverty and perjury go together.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a certain bond of union between them,
though, especially in a case like this, where such evidence
as this fellow proposes to give would, if unshaken,
clear the reputation of a wealthy woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has asked for nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Gastineau rejoined cynically, &#8220;that will, in the
order of things, come afterwards. He would at least
have a strong claim on the lady&#8217;s gratitude. No, my
dear Geoffrey, we must walk warily in this new development,
and not jump at the conclusion that our case<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
is already won. I have seen too many of these dramatic
surprises not to mistrust them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Herriard laughed, a little uncomfortably. &#8220;You are
inclined to be pessimistic, Gastineau.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pessimism is just experience&#8217;s drag-chain on man&#8217;s
natural sanguineness,&#8221; Gastineau returned with his
knowing shrug. &#8220;An habitual optimist makes a fine
explorer but a poor lawyer. Certainly the practice of
our profession does not conduce to optimism. But here
I am only counselling caution and warning you to look
all round this new evidence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Old John Bowyer is long-headed enough; he has
sifted it pretty finely, and relies upon it,&#8221; Herriard
urged, somewhat vexed at the douche of cold water
which his friend seemed so unaccountably inclined to
play upon the important discovery.</p>

<p>&#8220;John Bowyer is shrewd enough,&#8221; Gastineau agreed,
&#8220;but he is at his wits&#8217; end as to how he is going to win
this case. I wonder, my dear boy, that you have not
yet discovered how widely the two branches of the profession
are apt to differ in their estimates of the value
of any given piece of evidence. A solicitor somehow
never seems to get outside the law, beyond the purely
legal aspect of a question or a deposition: he seems to
lack the counsel&#8217;s faculty of forecasting the effect upon
the judge, the jury, and, above all, on the other side.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you think,&#8221; Herriard suggested, almost in disgust,
&#8220;that we ought to set no value on this man&#8217;s
evidence?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t say that, Geof; but I can&#8217;t help seeing several
weak spots in it. Properly handled by the other
side, and it is the kind of nut Macvee loves to crack,
it might very easily break down and go for nothing.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>&#8220;I should be sorry if it did miss fire,&#8221; Herriard said
gravely. &#8220;It would be a heavy blow for the Countess
Alexia. She thinks her case is won now; and, of course,
it means everything to her.&#8221;</p>

<p>A peculiar light shot through Gastineau&#8217;s eyes, the
gleam in those of a lazy beast of prey roused by the
sign of a prowling rival. &#8220;You have seen the Countess&mdash;already?&#8221;
he enquired, with the suggestion of a sneer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Naturally. Young Bowyer and I went to Green
Street as soon as we had satisfied ourselves about the
depositions.&#8221;</p>

<p>With Gastineau&#8217;s smile the sneer was more apparent.
&#8220;A personal interest in one&#8217;s client,&#8221; he remarked, &#8220;is
charming, but hardly business-like. It is apt to warp
the judgment, my dear Geoffrey. I fancy there is more
than professional <i>kudos</i> at stake here. You want this
new evidence to be conclusive and overwhelming, consequently
you fancy it is all you desire. I fear that,
for the first time in our partnership, my dry precepts
and unprejudiced advice will be unheeded.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know why you should say that,&#8221; Herriard
protested, flushing slightly.</p>

<p>Gastineau laughed. &#8220;My dear fellow, if I could not
see what is so fairly obvious, I should not be of much
use as your guide, philosopher and friend. I don&#8217;t
blame you. Countess Alexia is, no doubt, a very handsome
and fascinating woman, and even lawyers have
hearts, although they don&#8217;t often get credit for them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Herriard laughed, perhaps to cover his discomposure.
It is in the early stages of affairs of the heart that intrusiveness
is strongly resented. &#8220;Your vision is keen
enough, my dear Gastineau; so keen that it seems superfluous
to eke it out with imagination.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>&#8220;Is it imagination?&#8221; The question was put sharply,
searchingly, and Herriard rather winced under it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid it is,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;Nevertheless it
might not be a bad thing for me if there were to be
some truth in it; don&#8217;t you think so?&#8221;</p>

<p>The inscrutable light was in Gastineau&#8217;s eyes; an expression
which gave no clue as to the man&#8217;s intentions
or feelings. A very mask it was to the working of the
busy brain.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is a question which I must confess my utter
inability to answer off-hand,&#8221; he replied, as the eyes
half closed, veiling the enigmatical light within. &#8220;It
might be a good thing; it might be a very bad thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The case, the lady&#8217;s character, is <i>sub judice</i>,&#8221; Gastineau
laughed. &#8220;You had better pause in any step
you may be contemplating till the verdict has been
given.&#8221;</p>

<p>Herriard rose. &#8220;My dear Gastineau, I don&#8217;t know
whether you are joking, but surely you must know that
Countess Alexia is absolutely innocent of this monstrous
charge.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gastineau, however, looked anything but convinced.
He shook his head half-humourously albeit there was
no humour in the sharp eyes. &#8220;Beware, my son, of
allowing your judgment to be warped by personal considerations.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Personal considerations?&#8221; Herriard burst out. &#8220;I
hope I am not such a fool. But I would stake my reputation,
my very existence, on the fact that the Countess
had no more to do with Martindale&#8217;s death than you
or I.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You would most likely be right; possibly be wrong,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
Gastineau returned, in the drily sententious tone he
could assume when direct argument seemed inexpedient.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean to say,&#8221; Herriard demanded warmly,
&#8220;that you really believe her guilty?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean to say,&#8221; Gastineau rejoined, stretching out
his hand with a smile, &#8220;that I am not going to quarrel
with you about it; so good-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Herriard took his hand. &#8220;Gastineau,&#8221; he said, almost
imploringly, &#8220;do, for pity&#8217;s sake, look at this affair
with a more charitable eye.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I will, my dear fellow,&#8221; the other responded,
with an almost affectionate touch and tighter
clasp of the hand. &#8220;Of course I will. Only you must
remember, if I am to be of any service to you in this
business, that the charitable is not necessarily the legal
or the correct view of the possibilities of the case.&#8221;</p>

<p>The manner in which he spoke was so winning that
all Herriard&#8217;s soreness left him. But he judged it wise
to discuss the case no further that evening. When,
after a few words more, he turned to go, Gastineau
called him back.</p>

<p>&#8220;By the way, Geof, for we must not let my scepticism
burke this evidence altogether, what sort of a
man was this that Campion saw? He described him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A dark, thin man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m! A trifle vague. Anything more?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bowyers have the full description. Naturally&mdash;always
supposing his evidence to be genuine&mdash;he would
have noticed him particularly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt,&#8221; Gastineau agreed, with a recurring touch
of scepticism. &#8220;He is sure he would recognize the man
again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, absolutely confident. I heard him say so.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>&#8220;Well, it is a comparatively narrow circle,&#8221; Gastineau
remarked, still with the incredulous smile. &#8220;The man
must, in all probability, have been either a guest or a
waiter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Campion says he looked like a gentleman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! Then Bowyer had better get a list of the guests
and set about identifying him. Good-night.&#8221;</p>

<small>HERRIARD AND ALEXIA</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A LESS keen observer than Gastineau might have
suspected that the position of Herriard and Countess
Alexia was, at any rate on Herriard&#8217;s side, rapidly
exceeding that of counsel and client. And it was, particularly
in a man of Herriard&#8217;s temperament, scarcely
to be wondered at. All through the trying stages of
the case he had been brought into close and more than
mere professional relations with the von Rohnburgs,
while between him and the Count a friendship, founded
on the secure foundation of reciprocal liking, had sprung
up. Firmly and absolutely convinced as Herriard was
of Alexia&#8217;s innocence, so completely, indeed, that the
slander roused him to a quite unlawyer-like state of
indignation, it came as a shock to find Gastineau coolly
arguing upon the supposition and accepting the fact that
she was guilty. Certainly, he told himself, Gastineau
does not know her, has but a vague recollection of her
over some four or five years back; he takes her as a
mere pawn upon the legal chess-board: he has a cynical
disbelief in women; it is but to be expected that he
should think the worst of her; I might have realized all
this, and not been such a fool as to resent his suggestion.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the bare idea that any one, even a dry,
quibbling lawyer, could for a moment admit the possibility
that this woman, whose soul shone clear and true
from her eyes, whose every word carried a conviction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
of honesty, could have done a man to death in secret,
and then have entrenched herself behind a rampart of
skilfully-woven lies, was to him utterly inconceivable.
True, the deed, had she really been guilty of it, would
naturally have been committed under stress of great
provocation. Captain Martindale&#8217;s character and want
of principle where women were concerned were well
known: no one would have been surprised at his finding
a reprisal at the hand of those whom, as a chartered
Philander, he had loved and laughed at. Natural, too,
it would have been, if having been driven to that fatal
stroke, she should have fought against discovery by
every means in her power. For, putting aside the consequences
of the deed, it would have been a fight for
her honour. No; it was not the probabilities of the
case, considered generally, which weighed with Herriard,
but his utter inability to believe this thing of this woman.
And, as his feeling for her almost insensibly grew
warmer, the more preposterous did the notion appear.
So when Gastineau mooted it in his cold-blooded, cynical
way, it came as a shock, as a suggestion which filled
Herriard with abhorrence. His whole soul recoiled from
the idea, as from a monstrous impossibility.</p>

<p>And this conviction was confirmed when, a night or
two afterwards, he dined quietly with the Countess and
her brother. All through her animated talk, happier
now, in the good news that had come, he searched her
face for a sign of guile, of a reservation of the truth, of
an <i>arri&egrave;re pens&eacute;e</i>: looked till he was ashamed of himself
for being led to doubt; and saw nothing but frankness
and honesty. Clever she was, and possessed of wonderful
self-command, but it was a cleverness unmixed with
deceit, the reverse of wisdom, not falsehood.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>Both Alexia and her brother were cheerful that night,
happier than they had been since the charge was first
levelled. There was a second guest, a countryman of
the von Rohnburgs, Dr. Hallamar, the Austrian surgeon
who had returned to England on a professional visit. It
was a pleasant little party; the four being all completely
in accord and sympathy. The doctor naturally felt
strongly the way in which the Countess had been treated;
he was a strong man, an acute thinker who suggested
rather than expressed the depth of his opinions.</p>

<p>After dinner the two guests were left for a few moments
alone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Herriard,&#8221; the doctor said, with more warmth
than he seemed given to show, &#8220;you are a lawyer; it
is your professional duty not only to defend but to
think the best of your client, to maintain her innocence
against the world; but now, tell me, not as a lawyer,
but as a man, I will not say an English gentleman, for
there the code of honour guides and restricts you, but
as a man of brains and worldly knowledge, you do not
in your heart believe that it is possible for our hostess
to be guilty of this dastardly charge?&#8221;</p>

<p>Herriard had little difficulty in responding to the
somewhat extraordinary invitation. &#8220;I should be
willing to stake my life on the Countess&#8217;s absolute
innocence,&#8221; he declared resolutely.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was sure of it,&#8221; the other observed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You, too, Doctor,&#8221; Herriard continued eagerly,
&#8220;you are a man who has doubtless seen much of human
nature and its capabilities of deception, does your observation
tell you that disingenuousness is possible here?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hallamar shook his head emphatically. &#8220;Not for
one moment.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>&#8220;I am glad to have your confirmation of my conviction,&#8221;
Herriard replied. &#8220;But I would maintain it
against any man&#8217;s opinion for all that,&#8221; he added with
a smile.</p>

<p>The doctor merely acknowledged his enthusiasm with
a gesture as Count Prosper rejoined them.</p>

<p>When they went upstairs the Count and Hallamar
became deep in a discussion in their own language, and
Herriard found himself with Alexia.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have a downright champion, Countess, in the
Professor,&#8221; Herriard said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was hoping,&#8221; she returned, &#8220;that I no longer
needed one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope and believe so too,&#8221; he replied. Then added
in a lower tone, &#8220;I shall be sorry though, to think that
my office has come to an end.&#8221;</p>

<p>For an instant her eyes rested on his face, then she
looked away. &#8220;It may, happily, come to an end officially,
since its work will have been accomplished, but
it will never be forgotten.&#8221;</p>

<p>The last words were spoken low, with just the suspicion
of a tremor in them. It seemed to pass to Herriard,
as he responded, &#8220;Ah, Countess, how you reward
me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Reward you? Can I ever do that?&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed you can, far above my deserts,&#8221; he answered,
with the spell of her voice and presence, of her mood
attuned, as it seemed, to his own, thrilling through him.
&#8220;Although it is unnecessary; the fight in your cause has
been its own reward.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a little pause, as though the subject had
run as far as it might venture. Then Alexia spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, if I dared believe that the worst was over now!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>&#8220;I think you may,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;I do not see how
this new evidence can be shaken.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not absolutely certain?&#8221; Her eyes were
fixed on his face, and he felt she was reading him.</p>

<p>He thought of Gastineau and his almost scoffing scepticism.
He longed to feel able to tell her that all fear and
doubt were passed, yet, with the memory of his mentor&#8217;s
views, he could not, and felt a brute in consequence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe it,&#8221; he answered, hoping the evasion was
not apparent. &#8220;My own opinion is that this man&#8217;s
evidence settles the question so far as you are concerned.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you think others may not share it?&#8221; she asked
shrewdly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;that others, who are interested,
as half the world is, in believing the worst,
may be reluctant to share it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alexia was leaning back, bitterly reflective. &#8220;The
world, our world, is very cruel,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;The world,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;craves for amusement.
Left to its own resources it is a dull world, and is constantly
growing duller. So its amusements must ever
be increasing in pungency. Strong contrasts and mental
vivisection are its intellectual pastimes, the cant of
a spurious broad-mindedness which affects hesitation
in condemning vice, since there is none who can claim
virtue, and at the same time prejudges the maligned
for a like reason. Our modern Pharisees&#8217; boast is not
that they are virtuous, but vicious, and they call Heaven
to witness that they claim to be no better than the rest
of mankind.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alexia was looking at him searchingly with a touch
of disappointment.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>&#8220;You are a cynic,&#8221; she said simply, yet with wistful
conviction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not I,&#8221; he replied frankly, and at his prompt denial
her face brightened.</p>

<p>He hated himself for so easily falling into the trick
of Gastineau&#8217;s pessimistic speech. &#8220;No: I am a believer
in the honest, right-thinking minority, although
my profession prevents me from shutting my eyes to
the mental attitude of the rest. On the surface, at any
rate, it is a cruel world, Countess, and I am more sorry
than I can express, to know that you, of all women,
have felt its hardness, its injustice. But please don&#8217;t
think me a cynic.&#8221;</p>

<p>The smile she gave more than reassured him. &#8220;I
won&#8217;t,&#8221; she murmured, &#8220;although I began to fear you
were one.&#8221;</p>

<p>His voice was low as hers as he rejoined, &#8220;I never
shall be now that I have known you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed now. &#8220;If it were not too serious for a
joke I should tell you to wait till our case is decided.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Countess,&#8221; he protested, &#8220;it has long been decided
in my mind, unassailably decided.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; she said, &#8220;that was your duty. You could
scarcely do less than believe in your client.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I might,&#8221; he rejoined, &#8220;have done much less.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what convinced you?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;My client herself,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>Then again, just as their hearts seemed to come near
to one another, they drew away again. Perhaps to her
the time appeared not ripe, while on his part, a chilling
shadow seemed to intervene between him and his love;
the figure of Gastineau, the brain, whose mouthpiece
he was.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>His relations with Gastineau formed, indeed, a consideration
which had begun to exercise his mind very
disagreeably, and which he felt must in honour make
him pause before declaring his love for Alexia. She
would take him as he took her, judging by fair outward
appearance, by the affinity of their beings, by&mdash;in short&mdash;by
that reciprocal personal attraction which produces
love. On her side, doubtless, the foundation for
regard, the regard which he hoped and believed was
ripening into love, had been admiration. He had been
in her service skilful, courageous, chivalrous; he seemed
to have sprung to her side when sorely pressed, as her
champion, almost heaven-sent, and, apart from the professional
relation in the matter, her gratitude and admiration
were unbounded. No doubt the personal element
had much to do with this. Chance might have given
for her defence a dry, crabbed old lawyer, a Macvee,
dusty, aggressive and uncompromising, who would yet
have served her well, at the same time regarding her
merely as a client rather more interesting than usual.
But Geoffrey Herriard was very different. He was comparatively
a young man; he had, if not a handsome,
at least an interesting clear-cut face; he was an attractive
personality, a rising politician, an already risen
member of the Bar. His career was assured, and his
history carried with it that interest which successful
cleverness can always claim. What wonder, then, that
Alexia, almost a woman of the world, at least a <i>femme
faite</i>, though she might be, should grow more and more
attracted by her counsel who had quickly become her
friend as well as her brother&#8217;s?</p>

<p>And yet, as Herriard kept telling himself all through
the days and nights, he was a lie; a living, pleading,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
arguing, ingratiating lie. His form, his voice were his
own, and that was all. The brain he took credit for
was another man&#8217;s. The telling speeches, the masterly
conduct of the case, the shrewd arguments, even the
smart retorts by which he scored, were no more his than
are Shakespeare&#8217;s lines the actor&#8217;s who utters them.</p>

<p>So he stood that day, a fraud, a living sham, a man
who took credit for achievements which were not his,
for work which he, unaided, could never have brought
to a successful accomplishment. And the worst of his
position was, as he now felt it, that the excuse he might
make told against him, was, in fact, the crux of his
situation. For its avowal, the confession of the fraud,
was out of the question. Were he not bound in honour
to the friend, to whom he owed everything, not to divulge
the secret; could he for very shame make it
known that for years he had been living and thriving
and gaining fame by another man&#8217;s brains? True, the
situation had been acquiesced in by the other man, but
would that be accepted as an excuse by the world which
had hailed him, Geoffrey Herriard, as a supremely clever
fellow? The world would feel it had been swindled out
of its applause; it would turn and resent the cheat.</p>

<p>Then, supposing he cared nothing for the world and
its sneers, that he was prepared to brazen the matter
out, should it come to light, to let its success justify
the trick, how would it be with Alexia? Could he ever
hope to rehabilitate himself in her eyes? He told himself,
he knew it with absolute conviction, that she was
as the soul of honour; how could he declare himself to
her as an incarnation of falsehood? Sometimes he felt
he could wish that she were guilty of this charge; it
would at most have been a venial crime, and it would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
bring them a little nearer to an equality in wrong-doing.</p>

<p>Then, often, in the conflict of his love, he would wish
that he could break himself free of Gastineau: that he
could run alone now, looking upon the past partnership
as a term of mere pardonable tutelage. Then honour,
never driven out from his false life, would rise and rebuke
him for ingratitude. Still, he would argue, the
bond between himself and Gastineau could scarcely be
expected to run for the term of their lives. It would
have to be determined sooner or later; and, after all,
the benefit derived from the partnership was in some
degree mutual. The sword which Gastineau had put
into his hand, and the skill in fence which he had taught
him, had been greatly used to stab the disabled fencer&#8217;s
rivals and enemies, to prevent them from profiting by
the disappearance of their old adversary. In the intoxicating
whirl of success which had hurried him onwards
and upwards, Herriard had not found pause to
realize the true, inevitable logic of his position. Love
was now the Nemesis which was bringing it bitterly
home to him.</p>

<p>And that same night the foreshadowing of another
and totally unthought-of contingency rose to disturb
him. This time it came from his fellow guest, and in
this way.</p>

<p>The men had bid the Countess good-night, and had
gone down to the Count&#8217;s study to smoke and chat
before separating. Presently their host began to ask
the Professor about his work, and then it was that Herriard
learned a fact which gave him food for thought,
welcome or unwelcome, he could not for the moment
decide. He had met Dr. Hallamar several times already,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
had accepted without further question the fact that he
was one of Vienna&#8217;s most distinguished pathologists,
and although inclined to wonder that one so eminent
and naturally sought after at home should spend so
much time in England, had, from a reluctance to talk
&#8220;shop,&#8221; which his good breeding prompted, spoken
little to the doctor of their respective professions. But
now he was for the first time to be made aware of Hallamar&#8217;s
specialty.</p>

<p>The basis on which the Professor&#8217;s fame, now European,
rested, was the treatment of spinal disease and
lesions, in the practice of which he had performed some
marvellous cures. And Herriard had up to that moment
never been aware of this.</p>

<p>&#8220;Severe spinal injuries are not, then, necessarily incurable?&#8221;
he asked, waking up to the knowledge and
the interest the subject held for him, as he joined in
the conversation with somewhat remarkable eagerness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly not,&#8221; was the doctor&#8217;s laconic reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Even when the patient has been deprived of the use
of the lower limbs?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hallamar gave a shrug. &#8220;Some cases are incurable,
yes. But it has been my privilege to cure many which
had been pronounced hopeless.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The results of accidents, say railway accidents?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly. It is to railway accidents that very
many, if not the majority, of these cases of total loss
of power in the lower limbs from shock are to be attributed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you cure them, Professor?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hallamar bowed, with a little deprecating smile. &#8220;I
have the happiness to cure many.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, Herriard,&#8221; Count Prosper struck in.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
&#8220;That is why the Professor is here. One does not
travel a thousand miles to make experiments: one need
not leave Vienna for that, eh? But what is fame?
Here is Herriard, a great man at the Bar and in Parliament
who has never heard of the wonders which Professor
Rudolph Hallamar performs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When one is deeply immersed in one&#8217;s own profession,
one has little opportunity for looking round at
the work of other men in other spheres,&#8221; the doctor
observed, in polite excuse. &#8220;I have found that pathological
work has little interest for healthy laymen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nevertheless,&#8221; Herriard replied, with more truth
than the two other men gave him credit for, &#8220;your
work, now I have heard of it, does interest me exceedingly.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br />


<small>THE PROFESSOR IS PUZZLED</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IN spite of the sceptical attitude which Gastineau
seemed inclined to maintain towards it, the evidence
of the man Campion, having been closely sifted
and tested, was regarded on all hands as practically
conclusive, and certain to win the case for the Countess
Alexia.</p>

<p>The mouthpieces of public opinion, as is usual in such
cases, hastened to hedge, and the vane of prejudice
showed signs of swinging round. The defendants and
their advisers were now concentrating their energies
upon getting out of an awkward position with least
damage to their purses and reputations: and it was
generally admitted that this new evidence, although it
went but a little way towards proving who was the
slayer of Captain Martindale, must at least, if unshaken,
exonerate the Countess.</p>

<p>Still the mystery remained almost as deep as ever.
Who, every one now began to ask, was the mysterious
man whom Campion saw? A scrutiny among the list
of the guests failed to give any hopeful clue, and only
served to increase the puzzle. For there had been a
great crowd at Vaux House that night. The ball had
been one of those entertainments which great hostesses
give periodically to include all who can have any sort
of claim upon their hospitality. Cards had been sent
out to every one of the Lancashires&#8217; acquaintance, social,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
political, and casual; there had been the usual crush,
a constant stream of incomers and outgoers, and no
record kept of those who actually were present. How
could the identity of one man be discovered? Campion
was confident that he would recognize him; but where
was the chance of bringing into review before him the
hundreds of men who had been included in that big
social sweeping-up? The dead man might be supposed
to have had enemies, disappointed rivals of the notorious
supplanter: but that was only vague conjecture; nothing
definite of any one was known.</p>

<p>But one evening Herriard rushed up to the house in
Mayfair with a great piece of news. To his discomfiture
Gastineau was, for the second time during their
acquaintance, denied him. Hencher had the same tale
as before to tell. Mr. Murray had had a very bad day;
had been and still was in great pain; the seizure would
surely go off soon, and then he would see Mr. Herriard,
but not now; he was sure Mr. Herriard would understand
and would be kind enough to return in an hour
or two.</p>

<p>Herriard turned away from the door, his disappointment
at the delay merged in remorse for what he told
himself was cruelty and vile ingratitude. Here was this
man who had been to him more than a friend or a
brother, who had been, from a worldly point of view
at least, his good genius, the mainspring of his success,
lying writhing in pain, while he, selfish coward, with
the healer, this great Viennese specialist at his very
door, hesitated to bring him to his succour. For it
was now some days since he had known the field of
Dr. Hallamar&#8217;s surgical skill; he had, amid great pressure
of work, so much must be admitted in his excuse,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
debated the question with himself, and hesitated as to
his course. Why had he delayed? His conscience told
him that it was because Gastineau&#8217;s recovery meant his
own ruin. With an active life again open to him it
was not to be supposed that his master would care to
continue the strange partnership. Besides, would he
not at once become his rival, and, with the shining forth
again of the stronger natural light, must not his artificial
beam be effectually paled? Still, these considerations
were not, he told himself, those which a man of
honour could entertain. His duty to his friend and
helper was clear. He must do it, and chance the consequences,
relying upon Gastineau&#8217;s generosity and,
perhaps, gratitude.</p>

<p>He was not so certain of these. There came at times
into Gastineau&#8217;s eyes an ugly, wolfish look, a cold,
merciless gleam that seemed to say that nothing but
the physical strength was lacking for him to fall upon
and rend any one who might stand in his way. And
on such occasions Herriard had, in spite of himself,
experienced a kind of satisfaction from the thought
that the man lying before him with the fierce, pitiless
will was crippled; that the bitter, unscrupulous soul
was fettered in that prison of the half-dead body. At
times Gastineau would almost frighten his pupil when
for a moment he unleashed the hounds of his almost
Satanic spite; then he would laugh off the outburst, and
ascribe it to his condition. But there was no doubt
that fear, though scarcely acknowledged, had something
to do with Herriard&#8217;s hesitation in the matter of calling
in Dr. Hallamar.</p>

<p>Impatient and self-reproachful, Herriard went into
the Park. He was in no mood to go home or to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
House of Commons, he would wait about near at hand
for an hour or so until he could see Gastineau. The
news he had to tell him was momentous, and then he
was resolved to broach the subject of the Austrian
specialist without further delay. He could not bear to
think of his friend lying there helpless in paroxysms of
agony while he, who owed him everything, was inhuman
enough to withhold the healing hand.</p>

<p>As he paced up and down the stretches of path, chafing
and remorseful, it occurred to him that just across
the way was Green Street, where he could get Dr. Hallamar&#8217;s
address and so save time, for he was determined
that, with Gastineau&#8217;s consent, not an hour more should
be lost in calling in the great surgeon. As he waited
to cross the drive, whom should he see coming towards
him but the very man who was in his mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Doctor, well met!&#8221; he greeted him. &#8220;I was
just on my way to our friends the von Rohnburgs to
ask for your address.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hallamar bowed. &#8220;For the few days longer I remain
in England I am staying at the <i>Hotel Britannia</i>. Can
I be of service to you? You are interested in my work,
yes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are very good, Doctor. I was going to propose
that you should visit a dear friend of mine. I only
wish that I had known of your work sooner.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Doctor bowed again. &#8220;Your friend suffers from
a spinal affection?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. The result of a railway accident. He is, poor
fellow, a helpless cripple. I should almost fear beyond
even your powers of healing. He was terribly hurt,
and for days after the accident it was thought he could
not possibly live.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>Hallamar, beneath his professional reticence, was evidently
interested.</p>

<p>&#8220;A bad case, doubtless,&#8221; he observed. &#8220;But bad
cases are not necessarily the least curable. It may
seem brutal to a layman, but we rather rejoice in bad
cases.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I think this one ought to delight you,&#8221; Herriard
suggested with a laugh. &#8220;It seems to me as bad
a case as you could have in a patient who continues to
live. And it must be a bad symptom, at least for him,
poor fellow, that he suffers at times a martyrdom of
pain.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hallamar&#8217;s face suddenly changed from an expression
of sympathetic interest to one of surprise and polite
incredulity. &#8220;Pain?&#8221; he repeated, &#8220;not as the result
of spinal paralysis?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Herriard replied, &#8220;so he tells me. He suffers
terrible paroxysms of pain at times. Why, is that a
rare symptom?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Unheard of,&#8221; the Professor answered, beginning now
to regard Herriard as a witness, whose testimony was
too inexact and irresponsible to be accepted. &#8220;Certainly,&#8221;
he added reflectively, &#8220;the pain you speak of
may result from some other cause, some lesion in a part
of the body unaffected by the spinal shock. Your friend
was perhaps hurt elsewhere in the accident?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Herriard replied. &#8220;I am pretty sure of that.
At least the doctors said so at the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m!&#8221; Hallamar could not understand it, but was
scarcely inclined to accept the symptoms on hearsay,
&#8220;The pain your friend complains of is in the head perhaps?&#8221;
he suggested, interested in spite of the untrustworthiness
of the report.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>&#8220;The head! No, the back,&#8221; Herriard corrected.
&#8220;He told me so.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Professor shook his head. &#8220;It could not be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A man,&#8221; Herriard objected, &#8220;be he ever so shattered
and paralyzed, would scarcely mistake a pain in
the head for one in the back, would he?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hallamar evidently thought it not worth while to
pursue the argument.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hardly,&#8221; he agreed. &#8220;Still in the absence of any
other injury a headache is all that we could prognose.&#8221;
Then, in answer to the other&#8217;s perplexed expression, he
added, &#8220;You see Mr. Herriard, it is a very simple and
safe assertion to make. Shock and injury to the spine
produce paralysis of the nerve ganglions and consequent
loss of sensation; and where there is no sensation there
can be no pain. The telegraph wires, so to speak, between
the brain and the supposed seat of pain are
severed; how then can the sensation of pain be communicated?
You must have misunderstood your friend.
Well, this is an unprofitable discussion. If you would
like me to see the case I have still a few days more in
England, and if a cure by my treatment seemed likely
I might even arrange to extend my stay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed I should,&#8221; Herriard answered readily. &#8220;I
have been reproaching myself for having let the opportunity
of obtaining your advice so far slip by.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dr. Hallamar took out his note-book. &#8220;Will you
give me your friend&#8217;s name and address?&#8221;</p>

<p>In a moment the idea of caution, which Gastineau&#8217;s
position imposed, flashed upon Herriard. &#8220;Would you
mind my leaving the matter for an hour or two?&#8221; he
suggested. &#8220;I hope I do not seem ungracious, but perhaps
I ought to speak to my friend first, although it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
is not conceivable that he could have any objection to
putting himself under your treatment. I am going to
see him directly, and will leave a message at your hotel
later in the evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a curious look in the Professor&#8217;s eyes as
he returned the note-book to his pocket, a look into
which Herriard read a little pique at his seemingly unreasonable
hesitation. But he misread it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I presume,&#8221; said Herriard, as they turned and
walked together towards Piccadilly, &#8220;you have found
some interesting cases to have kept you over here so
long?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have,&#8221; Hallamar answered with some reserve.
&#8220;It has been to my advantage to stay here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, bigger fees than at home,&#8221; Herriard said to
himself. &#8220;You have, I suppose, the monopoly of your
treatment?&#8221; he added aloud.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly I have,&#8221; the Doctor replied, a little tartly.
&#8220;Why should I not reap the reward of my discovery?
The attitude of the medical profession, here especially,
is antagonistic to innovation and novelty. I meet them
in their own spirit. They withheld recognition, I withhold
my secret.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One cannot blame you. But surely, Professor, they
recognize the results of your treatment?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hallamar gave a shrug. &#8220;Grudgingly, oh, yes. Naturally
they hate a man to succeed where they must fail.
It shows up their incompetence. Now, tell me, this
friend of yours. How long has he been afflicted?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Between three and four years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes! He met with a railway accident, I think
you said?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>&#8220;In England?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, abroad,&#8221; Herriard answered guardedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;So!&#8221; The same curious look was on Hallamar&#8217;s
face. &#8220;He is in London?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, in Mayfair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In Mayfair? So! A convenient distance.&#8221; He
stopped suddenly and held out his hand. &#8220;Well, I will
go across and get a cab; I have some writing to do
before dinner. You will see your friend and let me
know this evening? My time is short.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, in an hour or two,&#8221; Herriard replied, and
they parted.</p>

<p>It was with a considerably lightened conscience that
Herriard presently made his way to Gastineau&#8217;s. Hencher
told him that his master was now much better and
would be glad to see him. When he went up Gastineau
seemed to be dozing, but roused himself and greeted
him with his usual languid cordiality. But there was
no languor in the eyes, they were bright and alert as
ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have had another bad bout,&#8221; he said apologetically.
&#8220;I am so sorry, Geof, not to have seen you just
now, only I might have been more sorry if I had. Now,
you have something to tell me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a good deal to tell you. First of all a great
piece of news. Our new witness Campion has seen and
recognized the man we are after.&#8221;</p>

<p>Over Gastineau&#8217;s face fell the smile of half-amused
interest, with which one listens to an important trifle
from a child. &#8220;Not the man whom he saw getting out
of the window?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. The very man. He is ready to swear to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, then you have him?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>&#8220;Unfortunately, no. He has been seen and recognized
and that is all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, that&#8217;s a pity.&#8221; To Herriard in any other mood
his reception of the news would have been irritating.
He seemed wilfully incapable of anticipating any advantage
from this evidence. &#8220;And why did Mr. Campion
stop there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He saw the man in a cab last evening. Before he
could get another to follow him up he had lost sight
of it,&#8221; Herriard explained.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, that was a pity,&#8221; Gastineau repeated, with the
same sarcastic drawl.</p>

<p>But the other ignored his tone. &#8220;Of course it was
a terrible pity. Still, it has established that the man
we want is about, and moreover it has refreshed Campion&#8217;s
memory as to his identity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything at the same time resting upon the said
Campion&#8217;s word.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Gastineau, why will you persist in being so
sceptical?&#8221; Herriard protested, at last a little irritated.
&#8220;No one but yourself sees any reason to doubt the fellow.
He has never contradicted himself, or swerved
from the straightforward story he first told.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he is not a fool, I grant you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I am positive he is not a knave. I wish you
could see him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gastineau gave an ugly laugh. &#8220;Thank you; I don&#8217;t
want to. It is unfortunate, seeing his seems to be a
pretty piece of dovetailed evidence, but I do not believe
in your Mr. Campion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is prejudice,&#8221; Herriard expostulated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Call it what you like,&#8221; Gastineau returned. &#8220;I
think you will find that I am right. This last move<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
of his was exactly what circumstances required, and is
precisely what I should have expected. How does he
describe the man he saw?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A dark man with black hair, a pale face and piercing
eyes. It is by the eyes, he says, that he would
recognize him anywhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you have not yet found out which of the
Duchess&#8217;s guests answers to that description?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is not easy,&#8221; Herriard replied, with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Gastineau returned. &#8220;I quite agree with you,
it is rather vague. And now, what is Mr. Campion himself
like?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Campion?&#8221; Herriard repeated, with a look of surprise
at the question.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us have his description, as I have not seen him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, there is nothing remarkable about him. He
is a somewhat thick-set man of five and thirty, with
rather a good, frank face.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can see that? He is clean-shaven?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; he wears a short brown beard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! Well, my dear Geof, I hope it may turn out
that my scepticism is unjustified.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have every reason to think it will,&#8221; Herriard returned,
in a rather nettled tone, as he closed the subject.
&#8220;And now, my dear friend,&#8221; he proceeded, in an altered
manner, &#8220;I have another matter to discuss with you
and one of which I hope you will think more favourably.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not, Geof?&#8221; Gastineau responded, with his
disarming smile. &#8220;Come, we don&#8217;t often disagree.
What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing less than a great chance of your recovery.&#8221;</p>

<p>If he had watched the other&#8217;s face for a joyful sign, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
did not find it. He could only set down the absence
of any sign of eagerness to Gastineau&#8217;s great power of
self-control. A curious gleam, which might mean anything,
flashed into his eyes, that was all.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, tell me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t wonder that you don&#8217;t seem to believe it,&#8221;
Gastineau&#8217;s manner forced Herriard to say. &#8220;But I
have come across a great man, a Viennese specialist,
over here just now, who has performed wonderful cures
in cases like yours.&#8221; He went on to tell him all he
knew of Dr. Hallamar.</p>

<p>Gastineau received the news with, to all appearance, a
singular apathy; only his eyes, which were fixed on Herriard,
gave evidence of a curious interest in the story.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he commented at length when Herriard had
said all he had to tell, &#8220;it seems wonderful, and well
worth trying.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am thankful to hear you say that,&#8221; Herriard exclaimed
heartily. &#8220;I was afraid from your manner that
your fit of scepticism was going to include Dr. Hallamar
and his treatment.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gastineau smiled. &#8220;I don&#8217;t say it does not. Still,
as a drowning man, I am thankful for any straw to
clutch at. How long do you say this Dr. Hallamar has
been in England?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was an awkward question, and none the less so
from the pointed manner of its putting. &#8220;He has been
over here some little time,&#8221; Herriard answered self-consciously.
&#8220;Stupidly I never thought to interest myself
in the man or his particular line, and have only just
found out his specialty. I have been reproaching myself
ever since.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not for long, I hope?&#8221; Herriard told himself there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
was something behind the words, but it may have been
that he was unduly sensitive on the point.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not for long, happily,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;Now,&#8221;
he added, rising, &#8220;you will let me go off and fetch him
round to you this very evening?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gastineau put out a protesting hand. &#8220;My dear
Geof, don&#8217;t fly off at a tangent. I have waited so long
that a few hours can hardly make a difference. Remember,
even eminent surgical wonder-workers must
dine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Still,&#8221; Herriard urged, &#8220;I had better let him know
without delay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We will,&#8221; Gastineau returned quietly; &#8220;I will write
him a note myself, and Hencher shall take it to his
hotel at once. Will you give me my writing-flap?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I really think I had better go myself,&#8221; Herriard
objected. &#8220;He may not know who you are, and so
delay&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will tell him and mention your name,&#8221; Gastineau
said, already beginning to write. &#8220;I would rather you
stayed with me: I have a little something to say to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Herriard looked through a magazine while the
other wrote. Hencher was presently summoned and
ordered to take a hansom to the <i>Hotel Britannia</i>, to
deliver the note into Dr. Hallamar&#8217;s own hands, and
to bring back an answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;You had something to say to me?&#8221; Herriard asked,
when the man had gone.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had,&#8221; Gastineau replied. &#8220;It is a matter which
I am sure will be less repugnant to you than it is to
me. But I am forced by circumstances to mention it.
You know, my dear Geof,&#8221; he continued, as Herriard
sat in silence, wondering what was coming, &#8220;you know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
I have never asked you for any share in the more material
rewards of the success to which I may claim to
have helped you. I have always hoped that the need
for any suggestion of the sort might never arise. Unfortunately
it has arisen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not unfortunately, my dear friend,&#8221; Herriard broke
in responsively. &#8220;I am only too glad if you are going
to give me the opportunity of reducing in a small degree
my immense debt to you which I could never hope to
repay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know that, Geof,&#8221; Gastineau replied. &#8220;I was sure
of it. Still I have never, as you know, till now, contemplated
any financial adjustment between us. As
it is, the present question of my ways and means which
I have been going into results in my being in need of
a thousand pounds.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Gastineau, I am only too delighted that
you have given me another proof of your friendship by
telling me. Luckily I have quite that at my bankers,
and will draw you a cheque at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, Geof,&#8221; Gastineau said simply, and Herriard
taking a blank cheque from his letter-case proceeded
to fill it in.</p>

<p>Presently Hencher came back with a note to say that
Doctor Hallamar would call early next morning.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will come round in the first half-hour I can snatch,&#8221;
Herriard said, as he took leave. &#8220;His will be to me
the most anxiously awaited of all the verdicts I have
been concerned in.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a strangely sarcastic smile on Gastineau&#8217;s
face as he replied, &#8220;I fear Geoffrey Herriard is not going
to win his case this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>So with much food for perplexity, Herriard left him.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br />


<small>A MAYFAIR COUNSELLOR</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">HERRIARD had indeed much to exercise his mind
that night. Thinking over his interview with
Gastineau, several things puzzled him. To begin with,
he was at a loss to understand his friend&#8217;s continued
attitude of disbelief in the value of Campion&#8217;s evidence.
He would never even be brought to admit that there
might be anything in it beyond an obvious trick for
obtaining money. Every one else held the testimony
to be invaluable; Gastineau alone maintained a rigid
scepticism.</p>

<p>Then Herriard could scarcely understand Gastineau&#8217;s
reception of the news about Dr. Hallamar. It was
to have been expected that he, lying there a helpless
cripple with an abnormally active brain, his spirit full
of energy, and the desire for action, so cruelly fettered
by his helpless limbs, would at least have shown more
eagerness at the hope suddenly brought to him. As it
was, he had fallen in with the suggestion of submitting
his case to the great specialist as coolly, even casually,
as though it had been merely a question of sending
round to the chemist&#8217;s for a box of lozenges. True, he
had lost no time about writing, and here arose another
question which perplexed Herriard.</p>

<p>Why had he insisted upon writing himself to Dr. Hallamar?
He had written the note, had sealed it up without
communicating one word of its contents, and had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
sent it off by Hencher; whereas the more natural course
would have been to let him, Herriard, who had an acquaintance
with the Doctor, and had already half arranged
the visit, be the messenger. He had kept him
there, ostensibly to speak of his need for a thousand
pounds; but surely a few seconds would have settled
that simple matter. The money could not have been
transferred before banking hours next day; the question
might have waited till later in the evening, for
Herriard, had he gone, would have returned with the
Doctor, as he had practically arranged to do. Why,
again, when Hallamar had expressed himself as at liberty
and willing to attend that evening, had he put off
his visit till the morning? Had Gastineau in his note
suggested this? And, if so, why the delay? Herriard
could not make it all out. Nor why his friend had suddenly
found the pressing need of a thousand pounds.
He had always understood that Gastineau had, during
his active life, made a sufficient fortune to assure him
easy, if not affluent, circumstances for the rest of his
days. His house was his own freehold, and, although
it was furnished in the most luxurious and costly fashion,
still that had been all capital expenditure and paid for
long since: his current expenses as an invalid, in an
existence of the strictest seclusion, with the smallest
possible household, could not be heavy. With the
single exception of indulging a hobby for buying valuable
books, he had, so far as Herriard knew, no extravagances.
As his debtor he was only too glad to let him
have the money, for the idea that all the profit of their
partnership was going to his share had often given him
qualms; still, why this sudden demand for a thousand
pounds? Gastineau might have told him; their relations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
assuredly justified confidence; nevertheless his
reasons had been studiously vague. A veil of mystery
seemed to be falling between the two men; it was useless
to blink the fact that of late their relations had been
gradually changing. Sometimes there had seemed, on
Gastineau&#8217;s side at least, to be a certain tacit antagonism
between them. Herriard could not understand it.
Was his friend thinking of making yet another man&#8217;s
fortune? Had he, himself, any cause for self-reproach
in his conduct towards his mentor? He could hardly
charge himself with that. Until the question of Campion&#8217;s
evidence had cropped up they had never had
even a difference of opinion. Herriard had never found
himself in a position to dispute the cleverer man&#8217;s judgment
until Gastineau&#8217;s assumption of that unaccountable
attitude towards the witness on whom so much
depended, and his refusal to make, at least, the best
of it.</p>

<p>One explanation suggested itself, and it was that his
friend&#8217;s brain might be gradually becoming affected.
It was not a pleasant solution, yet more natural than
any other alternative which might vaguely present itself.
He had that evening questioned Gastineau about
the pain which at times made him unfit to receive even
him, his one friend: telling him that Dr. Hallamar could
not understand the spinal injury at this stage causing
him more than irritation, and perhaps a little smarting
or burning. Gastineau had replied rather tartly that
he might be allowed to be the best judge of his own
sufferings, and that a man would feel pain in spite of
the theories of the whole medical faculty that he had
no business to have it.</p>

<p>So Herriard found no solution of his perplexities; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
more he thought of his friend&#8217;s conduct the more strange
and unaccountable did it appear; he could only postpone
the elucidation for the light of further developments.
And the first that came was one which gave
him no help towards enlightenment.</p>

<p>When, early the next day, he went to the house in
Mayfair to learn the result of the specialist&#8217;s visit, Gastineau
told him calmly that the verdict was adverse.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; Dr. Hallamar says he can do nothing for me,&#8221;
the patient reiterated, as Herriard seemed to question
his first announcement. &#8220;It is a bad case of spinal
paralysis following a crushing lesion, and hopelessly incurable.
Happily I was never inclined to indulge in
any real hope of a cure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; Herriard protested, &#8220;I understood that it was
in treating serious spinal lesions that Hallamar was so
successful. I don&#8217;t understand his giving you up at
least without a trial.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hallamar is manifestly a very clever man, a genius
possibly, in his own line,&#8221; Gastineau replied; &#8220;and your
really clever man always knows his limitations. It is
only pushing fools and quacks who blunder on till their
own incompetency pulls them up sharply. This man,
being no fool, and his interest being all the other way,
tells me, after a careful examination, that he can do
nothing for me. Neither you nor I, my dear Geof, need
go behind that verdict.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry,&#8221; said Herriard, in a tone of genuine
sympathy, &#8220;very sorry. I had set great hopes on his
curing you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gastineau&#8217;s harsh laugh seemed the outcome of repressed
disappointment. &#8220;You thought this wonder-worker
could revive the dead, for that is practically<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
what I am. Even a Hallamar cannot perform miracles.
As it turns out, my dear boy, you need have no cause
for regret that you did not bring this medico to me
sooner.&#8221;</p>

<p>Something in the tone of the last words put Herriard
on his defence. &#8220;I give you my word, Gastineau&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
he began warmly. But the other stopped him with a
gesture.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t trouble to protest,&#8221; he interrupted.
&#8220;No doubt you did everything for the best, and, as it
happens, could have done no more. I am here till I
die, and it is just as well to know it. Let us dismiss
the subject with a decree nisi. Now, can I help you
with anything to-day, or is it all plain sailing?&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Two days afterwards it happened that the Duchess
of Lancashire was at home to her more select circle of
intimates and courtiers, among the latter being Dormer
Greetland, whose profession it was to go everywhere,
that is to say, to every house worth entering where he
could get admittance. It was the eve of the great libel
trial, the last stage which it was now confidently expected
would triumphantly exonerate Countess Alexia
von Rohnburg from the stigma she had borne.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose it is quite certain that the Countess will
come out of it with flying colours?&#8221; Lady Rotherfield
enquired of the society newsvendor, a little anxiously,
seeing that, after a period of avoidance which might
be called judicious or snobbish, according to one&#8217;s mental
view of the conduct of her tribe, she had that very
afternoon left cards at the tabooed house in Green Street.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is bound to, on this man Campion&#8217;s evidence,&#8221;
Greetland assured her sympathetically. &#8220;They say the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
newspaper men are quite prepared for at least a month&#8217;s
imprisonment and a thousand pounds fine, which, of
course, means nothing to a man like Brailsford. They
say he has given Burwoods carte blanche to furnish his
room in Holloway in the most elaborate fashion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; Lady Rotherfield did not much care about
the peccant editors and their schemes for minimizing
the rigours of an enforced sojourn in an unfashionable
latitude. She was more interested in her tactical mistake
towards the von Rohnburgs who might still be a
power in her world.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; she murmured, &#8220;everybody has been
holding off a little? Of course things did at one time
look very black against the poor Countess.&#8221;</p>

<p>Greetland gave a shrug of sympathy which conveyed
a sort of confession of apology for pardonable short-sightedness.
&#8220;One hardly liked to call while the case
hung in the balance,&#8221; he protested. &#8220;It would have
seemed intrusive and prying; and, naturally, one hates
the idea of that.&#8221;</p>

<p>So spoke Mr. Dormer Greetland whose whole existence
was one long intrusion, and for whom earth held
no greater pleasure than was to be derived from prying
and the impertinent study of other folks&#8217; weaknesses
and distress.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, then people have not been calling? I wanted
to ask you, Mr. Greetland. You always know the rights
and wrongs of everything, and nowadays people, who
ought to know better, are given to such provoking inaccuracies,
don&#8217;t you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>The recognized fountain of scandal and arbiter of the
latest correct conduct accepted the compliment as merely
a truism. &#8220;It is a pity,&#8221; he pronounced, &#8220;that ignorant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
people will prattle absurdities, and that they find
others to believe them. Why, I can assure you, Lady
Rotherfield, that I have to spend half my time in contradicting
the most ridiculous fairy tales that idiots rush
about with. It is enough to disgust one with the present
state of things in society.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Lady Rotherfield assented, &#8220;as though it were
not bad enough to have all these outsiders pushing
themselves into our houses, without their bringing their
misleading half-knowledge of our affairs with them. So
the Countess will be quite rehabilitated? I am so glad.
She is really so clever and charming, and one shudders
to think what would have been the result if she had
been unable to establish her innocence; anyhow, <i>declass&eacute;es</i>
have such a terrible time, and give it to their friends.
I suppose it would not do to invite them to dine till the
case is really over?&#8221;</p>

<p>Greetland pouted dubiously. &#8220;There is, of course,
a certain risk, but it is scarcely worth considering, as
the case stands. On the other hand, it would be a
good move to show confidence, where one is practically
safe, and an invitation sent off before the verdict is
given would re-establish the <i>entente cordiale</i>. I know for
a fact that Herriard is absolutely certain of getting a conviction,
and of course that means the triumph of Alexia.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just so,&#8221; Lady Rotherfield agreed. &#8220;One may as
well send them to-night an invitation to dine next week.
So many people will like to meet her now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed,&#8221; the social Autolycus agreed. &#8220;The
Countess will be absolutely the rage, and it will be quite
the smart thing to give dinners to meet her. So I should
not delay, if you want to get her next week. There is
sure to be a rush for her.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>&#8220;Ah, yes, to be sure. People are so eager to make
the best of these little disappointments. I&#8217;ll send out
cards directly I get home. You&#8217;ll come, dear Mr.
Greetland? You must come. What day will suit you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t a night for the next three weeks,&#8221; answered
the much desired gossip.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but you must really come,&#8221; Lady Rotherfield
urged. &#8220;What people next week can you throw over
best?&#8221;</p>

<p>The <i>preux chevalier</i> consulted a gold-bound note-book.
&#8220;Let me see,&#8221; he murmured, as, with an air of due
importance, he ran through his thronging engagements.
&#8220;You know I&#8217;ll do what I can for you, dear lady.
Tuesday, the Andovers; Lady Andover would never
forgive me if I threw her over; Wednesday, the Zoylands;
half the Cabinet will be there, I must go and
make Lord Sarum tell me what we are really going to
do about Russia; Thursday, the Tudor-Fitzralphs; I
am to dine and go to the play with some poor people
who have just bought the Duke of St. Ives&#8217;s house in
Piccadilly; they are hopeless outsiders, by way of being
millionaires, of course, and all that, which is so tiresome,
but I have promised to do what I can for them,
and it would be an awful blow if I didn&#8217;t turn up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely you might throw the wretched creatures
over,&#8221; his would-be hostess suggested. &#8220;Millionaires
have no feelings, to speak of, or they would never have
become millionaires. Surely you are not going to let
such absurd people stand in your way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; Greetland responded; &#8220;they are too utterly
impossible and beneath consideration. One would think
as little of throwing them over as of pitching a pebble
into the Serpentine. But the difficulty is that I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
got Lady Hester Nayland to consent to go, and if I am
not there she will have no one to speak to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why does she go?&#8221; was Lady Rotherfield&#8217;s not unnatural
enquiry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Greetland explained, &#8220;it appears that Lady
Hester, who has taken up good works since Ormskirk
jilted her, landed the millionaire people the other day
at a bazaar with a lot of rubbish at fancy prices. They
are as keen on getting something more for their money
as she is for their money. So she has graciously consented
to dine with them on condition that she goes
into dinner with me and is not expected to speak much
to the <i>nouveaux riches</i>. Consequently, if I fail, poor
Lady Hester will be reduced to silence for a whole evening,
and you know, to put it mildly, she has no impediment
in her speech.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, indeed,&#8221; Lady Rotherfield replied, &#8220;except the
impediment it made to her marriage. They say Ormskirk
was absolutely stunned, and for a relief has gone
out to some spot on the Sahara where he won&#8217;t hear
the sound of a human voice for six months.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Greetland said, &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid it would be the
refinement of cruelty to leave Lady Hester in the lurch,
and she does in her heart so hate the <i>haute Juiverie</i>.
No, I see I am dining with the Ambroses on Friday.
They are unexceptional themselves, but rather injudicious
in their choice of friends. One never knows what
one is in for there. I once had to meet at their house
an awful person from the City who talked in multiples of
a million, and whose principal capital seemed to be
capital I&#8217;s. He had brought an absurd wife, festooned
with diamonds like a segment of a transformation scene.
I told Lady Ambrose that if she ever invited these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
farcical creatures again, which I hoped she would not,
she ought to arrange to have a lime-light man to throw
different colours on the pantomime person to vary the
monotony of the ill-gotten gems.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No wonder,&#8221; Lady Rotherfield observed, &#8220;diamonds
are going out of fashion with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, then,&#8221; Greetland decided, &#8220;it must be
Friday. If poor Lady Ambrose will be injudicious about
the people she asks one to meet, she must expect an
occasional disappointment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Friday, then,&#8221; said the lady. &#8220;It is quite good of
you. I will secure the von Rohnburgs at once. Ah,
dear Duchess,&#8221; she went on, as their hostess joined
them, &#8220;we were just talking of this tiresome case. How
you, to say nothing of the dear Countess Alexia, must
have been worried, and how glad you must be at the
prospect of seeing the last of it. Will the Duke have
to give evidence again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I&#8217;m afraid so,&#8221; the Duchess answered,
with a touch of ruefulness. &#8220;The poor Duke has been
bound over to appear again just as though he were
a common malefactor who would be likely to abscond.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How absurd,&#8221; Lady Rotherfield exclaimed, with as
much show of indignation as she could command.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; her Grace pursued. &#8220;I call it abominable
and most idiotic that there should be no distinction
made between people in our position and the common
herd whose native air is the atmosphere of a police
court. Why should a man like Lancashire be forced
to hang about the horrid dingy place, jostled by all
sorts of unpleasant people, and then be insulted and
browbeaten by unmannerly lawyers who would not dare<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
to speak to him anywhere else? I call it too disgusting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Duke must hate it,&#8221; Greetland suggested sympathetically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Naturally. He is most indignant about the whole
business. And the police-court ordeal, he says, is so
unconstitutional in his case. How can men in Lancashire&#8217;s
position expect to be looked up to, and to keep
up their dignity, if they are liable to be placed in these
ridiculous positions and made a laughing-stock for the
mob?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just so,&#8221; Lady Rotherfield agreed, in a tone of
compassionate indignation. &#8220;That is what I always
maintain. If Dukes and so forth are to have their
weaknesses exposed and to be exhibited as no different
from ordinary humanity, what becomes of their prestige
and influence? They ought certainly to be exempt from
these public exposures.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was going somewhat farther towards the truth
than the Duchess had intended. She looked rather
black, while Greetland&#8217;s face was a study of amusement
struggling with the professional decorum due
towards the Peerage.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Duke,&#8221; said her Grace tartly, &#8220;talks of bringing
the question before the House of Lords.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think, Duchess,&#8221; suggested Lady Rotherfield
sweetly, &#8220;that it would be wiser to let it drop?
You are not likely to have another affair of the sort
here, one would hope, and if it is debated, that terrible
<i>farceur</i>, Evesham, is sure to make fun of it and, incidentally,
of the dear Duke.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Duchess&#8217;s face lowered darker than ever. She
was very tenacious of her monopoly of gibing at her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
consort&#8217;s stupidity. Greetland, who had plenty of tact,
natural and acquired, was about to intervene with a
change of subject, when Aubrey Playford, who had just
come in, joined them with a suggestion in his manner
of something important to tell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you heard the latest news, Duchess?&#8221; he
asked quickly, as he touched her hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; what is it?&#8221; the Duchess enquired, in some
trepidation as she noticed the little malicious gleam of
pleasure in his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything to do with the case?&#8221; Greetland asked
casually. It was natural for him to hate people who
got before him with news.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very much to do with the case,&#8221; Playford replied.
&#8220;This new witness, Campion, whose evidence was to
settle it off-hand&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; exclaimed Lady Rotherfield breathlessly,
&#8220;he has not absconded?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Worse, for him, at any rate,&#8221; Playford answered.
&#8220;He has met with a fatal accident.&#8221;</p>

<p>The news was so startling that for a few moments
no one could speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;How unfortunate!&#8221; Lady Rotherfield commented
mechanically.</p>

<p>&#8220;How dreadful!&#8221; chimed in the Duchess, trying to calculate
how the incident would affect her interest in the
case.</p>

<p>&#8220;But is it true?&#8221; Greetland questioned sceptically.
He always made a point of challenging the authenticity
of news carried by other people.</p>

<p>&#8220;Undoubtedly true,&#8221; Playford returned emphatically.
&#8220;He was knocked down and run over by a hansom this
evening, and, curiously enough, just here in Piccadilly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
not a stone&#8217;s throw from where he made out he
originally saw Reggie Martindale&#8217;s supposed murderer.&#8221;</p>

<p>The propinquity of the tragedy slightly enhanced its
impressiveness.</p>

<p>&#8220;And he is dead?&#8221; The Duchess asked the question.</p>

<p>Playford gave a decisive nod. &#8220;Died before they
could get him to St. George&#8217;s Hospital.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are they sure it is the same man?&#8221; Greetland
suggested, holding tenaciously to his line of non-acceptance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Absolutely,&#8221; Playford answered. &#8220;My man told
me all about it. He saw the poor fellow being taken
away in the ambulance. And I made a point of calling
at the police-station to enquire if what I had heard was
true. There is no doubt that the man was Campion;
the Superintendent was quite positive. So I thought
I would come and tell you at once, Duchess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was very kind of you,&#8221; the hostess replied, as
graciously as her state of mind permitted. &#8220;Dear me,
this distressing business seems unending.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor Countess Alexia!&#8221; Greetland remarked, slyly
watching Lady Rotherfield.</p>

<p>The prospective hostess of the unfortunate Countess
had for the moment overlooked that consequence of
the tragedy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; she exclaimed, waking up to the fresh interest.
&#8220;This poor man&#8217;s death must make all the difference
to her, must it not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Decidedly,&#8221; Playford answered, with a readiness
bred of malice.</p>

<p>The Duchess had gone off to carry the news. Lady
Rotherfield turned to Greetland.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>&#8220;Oh, Mr. Greetland, how lucky this unpleasant news
came just now. Fancy one&#8217;s feelings if one had seen
it in the papers to-morrow morning, when the invitations
had been posted over-night! I do hope Lady
Ambrose won&#8217;t have another objectionable City person
to inflict on you next Friday.&#8221;</p>

<small>THE TRAGEDY DEEPENS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was a terrible and dismaying blow that had fallen
so tragically upon the hopes of triumph and vindication.
Herriard on his way to the Countess Alexia
with the news&mdash;which had been sent to him at once&mdash;called
at Gastineau&#8217;s, being anxious to gather every
grain of hope there might be of making the best of this
bitter disappointment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not come to worry you any more about Campion,&#8221;
was Herriard&#8217;s greeting, with a short bitter laugh
of discomfiture. &#8220;The poor fellow will never give evidence
now. He is dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gastineau gave him a sharp glance of surprised enquiry.
He was lying back in a state of greater listlessness
than Herriard ever remembered to have seen in
him since the first effects of the accident.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dead? How?&#8221;</p>

<p>Herriard told him. &#8220;It happened in Piccadilly, by
the Green Park; within sight of Vaux House. And it
is a bad blow for us, with all deference to your views.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear I must continue in disagreement with you,&#8221;
Gastineau returned, with a confident smile. &#8220;I am of
opinion that the cabman who knocked down the late
Mr. Campion has unwittingly done your side a substantial
service.&#8221;</p>

<p>Herriard took an impatient turn across the room.
&#8220;Gastineau, you carry your opinion, your scepticism,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
too far. Surely between us you need not make such a
point of maintaining it so obstinately.&#8221;</p>

<p>He spoke with a certain amount of heat, with the
sense of disappointment stinging him doubly, in his
heart and head.</p>

<p>As Gastineau&#8217;s eyes followed his impatient movement
they seemed to laugh subtly. &#8220;If,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you will
give the situation a moment&#8217;s calm thought, my dear
Geof, you will see what I mean by suggesting that by
this man&#8217;s death your client is no worse off, but, on
the contrary, has gained an advantage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would take a more penetrating intellect than
mine to see that,&#8221; Herriard returned, with ill-humoured
sarcasm.</p>

<p>&#8220;At least let me try to put it to you,&#8221; Gastineau rejoined,
with a smile at the other&#8217;s temper. &#8220;Now, take
the position dispassionately. First of all, what are you
going for? To clear Countess Alexia&#8217;s reputation of the
slander that has touched it. That, I grant you, with
this man Campion&#8217;s evidence you would have done triumphantly&mdash;if
it had withstood all the hot attacks which
would have been made upon it. The evidence he would
have given, had he lived, is now common knowledge;
his narrative, his uncontradicted narrative, has been
published by enterprising journalists; everybody knows
it. So you stand in the position to-day of having got
your examination-in-chief before the public without any
chance of cross-examination by the other side. Is not
that a score? You have succeeded in getting the world&#8217;s
sympathy for your interesting client, and it will be augmented
rather than diminished by this unlooked-for
incident, which will assuredly be regarded as a cruel
blow.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>&#8220;As it is,&#8221; Herriard murmured; beginning, however,
to see the cloud&#8217;s bright side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; Gastineau agreed; &#8220;but it won&#8217;t hurt
you. It is far, far better for you than one shaky answer
in the witness-box. Yes; to sum up, you have the <i>status
quo ante</i>, with the sympathy transferred to your side,
the dead man&#8217;s uncontradicted, and, now, uncontradictable,
evidence on record in the public mind. And
you must remember that, in a case of this sort, it is the
public, not the jury, which gives the real verdict. Yes,
my dear Geof, you are to be congratulated, or, at least,
the Countess is. Come! confess you see it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; Herriard answered, recovering somewhat
from the blankness of his discomfiture; &#8220;I admit we
are in a far better position now than before Campion
turned up. Still, I cannot agree that we gain by his
death. I am absolutely convinced that his evidence
would have remained unshaken before Macvee&#8217;s big
guns; and I cannot understand why you have all along
taken such a prejudiced view of the poor man and the
genuineness of his testimony.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is scarcely worth while discussing it now,&#8221; Gastineau
replied, with a half yawn. &#8220;I am quite ready
to admit that I may have been utterly wrong. Had
it not been for the seriousness of the issue I could be
sorry that the question of the stability of his evidence
can never now be settled. As it is we may consign the
question to the limbo of the great undecided, and rest
content with the gain it has brought us. I suppose the
poor fellow was dead when picked up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Herriard answered; &#8220;he lived for ten minutes,
and was able to give an account of the accident. It
appears he was running after a cab, in which he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
recognized again the man we are in search of, the man
who is supposed to have killed Martindale. In his excitement
poor Campion failed to notice a hansom which
swung out of Berkeley Street, and ran him down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m! I quite agree with you, it is a pity,&#8221; Gastineau
observed, in an indifferently sceptical tone; &#8220;a pity that
the all-important Mr. Campion has come to so unromantic
an end. It would have been highly interesting to
have seen what sort of a figure he would have cut in
the witness-box, with Joshua Standish Macvee for a
<i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can imagine but one result,&#8221; Herriard replied,
with a dry reserve. &#8220;Well, I am going on to Green
Street to do what I can to lighten this blow. Your view
of the matter will at least help me to do that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Gastineau agreed; &#8220;I think you may venture
to congratulate Countess Alexia. The reckless cabby
did your client no bad turn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps not,&#8221; Herriard returned; &#8220;but we did not
want to win like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Better like that than not at all,&#8221; Gastineau rejoined.
&#8220;You now have the Countess practically cleared so far
as the world is concerned. The passing of Campion rehabilitates
her by providing a very plausible, if, to legal
minds, somewhat unconvincing, solution of the mystery.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pointed significance in his tone was not to be
ignored. Herriard started up, impelled by the shock
of a conviction then first realized. &#8220;Gastineau,&#8221; he
exclaimed, in a tone of protest, almost of indignation,
&#8220;you are not going to tell me you think the Countess
guilty?&#8221;</p>

<p>The other smiled meaningly. &#8220;My dear Geof, I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
not blind to possibilities and probabilities, if you are;
but then, perhaps, I have not the same reason.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the first time that Herriard had known his
friend to sneer at him, and the tone of the last words
stung him uncomfortably. In that instant he realized
how the fissure between them was extending; and the
situation which seemed so swiftly developing was made
none the less unhappy by its incomprehensibility, by
its being devoid of an adequate cause. A difference of
opinion. Was that to dissolve the close partnership,
that alliance of theirs against the world? It seemed
pitifully absurd. Herriard had vowed that no act of
his should help to widen the breach. It was curious
how this case had come between them; there seemed
such animus behind Gastineau&#8217;s arguments, and as Herriard&#8217;s
feeling was all the other way, it became increasingly
difficult for him to keep to his resolve. &#8220;My dear
fellow, it is preposterous,&#8221; was all he could trust himself
to say. &#8220;I can hardly think you mean it seriously.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I merely say that I see nothing inherently improbable
in the suggestion,&#8221; Gastineau replied, in his keen
argumentative manner. &#8220;In fact, from the circumstantial
evidence we have, the probabilities are, <i>pace</i> the
late Mr. Campion, all the other way. I will simply put
one point to you. Why and how should another man,
the person whom Campion declared he saw, stab Martindale
to death with an ornament from Countess Alexia&#8217;s
hair? Why should he want to do it at all? and, if so,
why and how with that particular weapon? At least it
points to the Countess being an accessory before the
fact. Now I really should like to hear a good rebutting
argument against that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Herriard had turned away from him, and was leaning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
with his arms on the mantelpiece. &#8220;The argument is,&#8221;
he replied, in a voice low from restraint, &#8220;that the
Countess lost the ornament. And my unshakable belief
is that she had nothing to do with Martindale&#8217;s
death either as principal or accessory.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your argument is nebulously vague and just conceivable,
but at the same time wildly improbable,&#8221;
Gastineau returned, in his quiet, cutting tone. &#8220;But
that you seem not a little <i>&eacute;pris</i> with your fair client I
should not think you in earnest in putting it forward.&#8221;</p>

<p>Herriard raised his head and turned to the couch.
&#8220;Gastineau, if you really think the Countess guilty, for
Heaven&#8217;s sake, let the case never be mentioned between
us again. We don&#8217;t want to quarrel; it would ill become
me to be at issue with you to whom I owe so
much, but it is certain that if we pursue this subject we
shall quarrel, since my whole sense revolts from your
theory. So let it be taboo.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gastineau laughed, and his laugh was as a sneer at
the other&#8217;s heated earnestness.</p>

<p>&#8220;We never should have come near to joining issue had
you not let your heart run away with your head. A
lawyer ceases to be a lawyer when he allows feelings
and prejudices to interfere with his judgment. So far
as our profession goes a man must be all head, a legal
thinking machine, if you like. It is not perhaps an
ideal equipment, but it is the only workable one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I dare say,&#8221; Herriard replied, in a tone of doubtful
conviction. &#8220;Happily, or unhappily, very few of us
can quite succeed in stifling our private judgment of
those with whom we have to deal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True. And the man who succeeds best in that makes
the best lawyer, other things being equal,&#8221; Gastineau<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
returned dogmatically. &#8220;Now we won&#8217;t quarrel, Geof,
over the last word of this burning subject, but I must
give it you in the form of a word of warning. Let me
as an older man of the world than yourself, and as one
who has nothing more to gain or lose in this world, put
you on your guard against the state into which you are
drifting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I refer to the Countess Alexia. That is all, and I
will say no more, except that if you let yourself go too
far in that direction you will bitterly repent it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Herriard repressed the words that sprang to his lips.
&#8220;Very well, Gastineau,&#8221; he responded simply; &#8220;I take
your warning in the spirit in which it is given.&#8221;</p>

<p>An inscrutable smile flitted across Gastineau&#8217;s face,
as he nodded in response to the other&#8217;s words.</p>

<p>And so they parted.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Herriard went towards Green Street in a perplexed
and uneasy state of mind. There could be only one
explanation of Gastineau&#8217;s warning, and it was that he
believed Countess Alexia guilty. But that was utterly
preposterous. Herriard comforted himself with the
thought that his friend knew little of the Countess, having
only met her casually in society years before. His
was a hard, judicial brain; he would believe anything
of anybody if the legal probabilities pointed to such a
conclusion; the human element in the case, if not entirely
ignored, would be reduced to an equation and
governed by the law of mathematical chances. But,
logic or no logic, the idea that the Countess might be
guilty was monstrous. Knowing her as he did, Herriard
was sure that she had not even the most venial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
and innocent connection with Martindale&#8217;s death. Nor,
putting bias away, could he find the slightest ground
for discrediting Campion&#8217;s testimony. Well, thank
Heaven, the case would soon be brought, as he fully
anticipated, to a happy conclusion, and his relations
with the Countess need never again form the subject of
argument.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have brought you bad news,&#8221; he said to her when
they met.</p>

<p>Alexia&#8217;s face paled for an instant, as her eyes questioned
him apprehensively. He told her what had happened,
and the pros and cons of its probable effect upon
the case.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am inclined to think we are not so very much
worse off,&#8221; he said, &#8220;by the poor fellow&#8217;s death, shocking
as it is, and greatly as we must regret it. You
must not take it so much to heart, Countess,&#8221; he added,
for he could see how dismayed and anxious the news
had made her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but I fear, I fear,&#8221; she returned, in a low
voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed you need not fear,&#8221; he urged encouragingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I think what is at stake how can I help it?&#8221;</p>

<p>He leaned forward. &#8220;Countess, you have no cause
for fear,&#8221; he said half-interrogatively. The words were
spoken more to give Gastineau&#8217;s suggestion the lie than
to satisfy any doubt in his own mind. Next moment
he hated himself for the inflexion that made them seem
a question. With the swift intuition of a clever woman
she divined the subtle equivocalness of the speech. Perhaps
she felt it was not altogether uncalled-for, that it
was reasonable. She looked at him steadily, frankly,
and her look sealed his self-condemnation.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>&#8220;I have only one cause for fear,&#8221; she said, &#8220;a miscarriage
of justice, the possible success of a vile slander.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure of that, Countess,&#8221; he replied, with a
warmth bred of repentance. &#8220;And I should think none
the less of you if your fear extended farther. But I
have no dread at all of the issue of this case, and wish I
could infect you with my certainty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you have,&#8221; she responded, with an effort
at conviction. &#8220;But in this world things go curiously
wrong sometimes, and, while there is suspense, there
must, to a woman, at least, be fear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hate the thought of your fear,&#8221; he said in a lower
voice; &#8220;it seems to increase my responsibility.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alexia smiled. &#8220;No, no, my friend,&#8221; she protested,
&#8220;you must not think that. You, at least, cannot fail;
your victory is already gained.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet,&#8221; he replied deprecatingly; &#8220;still, I am confident
that it will be.&#8221;</p>

<p>A sudden thought came to him; the conviction that
if he were to put his fate to the touch it should be now;
that to wait would be the timid, unchivalrous trick of
an opportunist, and as he realized that the moment had
come he stood dismayed. He glanced at the Countess,
with a strange diffidence, for in his dealings with men
and women confidence had become almost as second
nature. The constrained silence that had come upon
them seemed to prick him on; each second it lasted
made the urgency cumulative. And yet words failed
him. What could he say to her? How could he say
it? His eyes rested on the graceful lines of her figure,
the exquisite colouring and contour of her head. She
was not a girl, but a woman of matured sensibilities
for sympathy and love; the one woman he had met<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
whom he longed to ask to share his life, the one woman
in whose company he would be more content to face
trouble than to pass a cloudless existence with any
other. Yet how could he but hesitate? She was above
him in rank; there was something royal in the very turn
of her head, in the subtle splendour that seemed to exhale
from her presence. True he was somebody now
in the world; he had made his name both at the Bar
and in the House. Then, with the encouraging thought,
the spectre of his deceit rose up and stood between him
and his love, till he wished she were guilty that they
might meet on more equal terms. Still, that present
one was the moment to be seized. That thought was
insistent; it was under the shadow of this sharp disappointment
that he must risk the question.</p>

<p>As he stood hesitating and tongue-tied, Alexia looked
up, as it were with a glance of enquiry as to the reason
of the silence. It was a provocative lifting of the
deep grey eyes, and it drew him into speech as though
moved by an enchanter&#8217;s touch outside the pale of calculation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Countess,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I wish I might, without offence,
ask for the crown of my victory.&#8221;</p>

<p>She seemed to shrink a little from him, as she replied
in a low voice, yet steadily, &#8220;The victory is not yet
won; the crown is of doubtful glory.&#8221;</p>

<p>His tongue was loosened now. &#8220;Never to me,&#8221; he
declared with passion. &#8220;Countess, it is all that I covet
in this world; it can never be anything less to me than
pure gold. Ah, if I might ever hope to wear it!&#8221;</p>

<p>But she made no responsive sign. &#8220;It is not time
to speak of that,&#8221; she said, in a voice in which the
feeling was so repressed that it seemed cold.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>&#8220;If,&#8221; he rejoined, in a like tone, &#8220;it may ever be,
surely this is the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again she looked at him; there was gratitude and,
he thought, something yet more to be desired in her
eyes. &#8220;No, my friend,&#8221; she said, with gentle denial;
&#8220;not now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Alexia,&#8221; he pleaded, laying his hand on her arm,
&#8220;let me tell you how I love you.&#8221;</p>

<p>But again she shook her head, and moved away from
the tentative caress. &#8220;No,&#8221; she replied; &#8220;you must
not speak a word of that to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet?&#8221;</p>

<p>She hesitated a moment or two, and in the pause his
hopes swiftly grew. Then, almost in a whisper, the
words came repeated, &#8220;Not yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he realized what those words meant, joy thrilled
him beyond all power of the restraint he owed her.
&#8220;Alexia, my love!&#8221; The cry burst out from the rapture
of his good fortune. But she turned quickly to
him, putting out her hands protestingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, please; not that,&#8221; she said, and in the entreaty
there was a touch of command. &#8220;I know that
you, of all men, will respect my wish.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is hard,&#8221; he returned submissively, &#8220;but I must.
If you knew how hard, dear Countess, you would forgive
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have nothing to forgive,&#8221; she replied simply; and
for a while no more was spoken between them.</p>

<p>Then their talk reverted to the burning subject of
the trial, till presently Count Prosper came in.</p>

<p>He had heard at his club the news of Campion&#8217;s death,
and the friends he was with had tried to lessen the
shock it gave him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>&#8220;You have an excellent man in Herriard,&#8221; Sir Perrott
Aspall had remarked encouragingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t have a better,&#8221; Baron de Daun had agreed.
&#8220;Quite the best man at the Bar for that sort of case,
since Paul Gastineau.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By the way,&#8221; another man of the group broke in,
&#8220;talking of Gastineau, an extraordinary thing happened
to me the other evening. As I was walking across the
Green Park a man passed me whom I could have sworn
was Paul Gastineau.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What, <i>the</i> Paul Gastineau?&#8221; Sir Perrott asked, with
a smile of toleration for another man&#8217;s stupidity.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>The</i> Paul Gastineau,&#8221; the other maintained. &#8220;The
K.C. Member for Starbury. I knew him well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; Sir Perrott objected, with all the superiority
which disbelief in the obviously impossible confers,
&#8220;Paul Gastineau, the K.C., and all that, was killed
some years ago in a railway accident in Spain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; retorted the other; &#8220;that is just what made
my seeing him in the Green Park so extraordinary.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br />


<small>A HALF-WON VICTORY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">DEPRIVED of its promised dramatic sensation scene,
the trial which came on in the next week was, being
mere repetition of what had been heard before, to all
but the interested parties, a comparatively tame affair.
By tacit consent the case was not mentioned again between
Gastineau and Herriard. There were one or two
points on which Geoffrey would have liked his mentor&#8217;s
advice, but he forbore to ask it; and, on the whole,
was well content, save for the responsibility of Alexia&#8217;s
reputation which was in his hands, to take for once the
whole burden of a big case on his shoulders.</p>

<p>He was nervous, more nervous than he had ever
been before, but that was to be accounted for by other
than professional reasons. Victory, he felt, would mean
everything to him: yet there were moments when he
could almost wish for defeat. It was something, however,
to think that if he won, it would be by his own
unaided conduct of the case, and somehow he felt that
he would not care for Gastineau to have a hand in the
victory.</p>

<p>Countess Alexia repeated her denial of all knowledge
of how Captain Martindale came by his death with unswerving,
convincing straightforwardness: the Duke of
Lancashire had his uncomfortable quarter of an hour
in the witness-box, but got off with less ridicule than
might have been expected, although with a by no means<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
modified conviction that persons of his class should be
by law exempt from such appearances, or at least from
cross-examination. The truculent and uncompromising
Macvee made a fiercely argumentative appeal to common
sense on behalf of his clients; Herriard an equally
logical and more chivalrously passionate speech for the
Countess, who was the real defendant, and at the end
of a two days&#8217; trial, after an ominously long deliberation,
the jury brought in a verdict of guilty against the peccant
editors who were duly mulcted in heavy fines, and
one, the worst offender, to a short term of imprisonment.</p>

<p>So the victory was gained; the popular appetite,
which was getting rather tired of the food, was satisfied;
yet, somehow, there seemed, after all, to be a cloud over
it in place of the glorious sunshine there should have
been. This feeling was borne uncomfortably in upon
Geoffrey Herriard as he went back to his chambers in
the Temple. There was joy in his heart: he could still
feel in his own the grateful&mdash;might he not now think
loving?&mdash;pressure of Alexia&#8217;s hand when he had congratulated
her and received for a reward a look that
told him his happiness was assured. Yet, underneath
all this elation, there lurked the thought that it was an
unsatisfactory victory. Doubt, that terrible doubt, that
hateful bugbear, had not been, as he had hoped, utterly
and finally annihilated. The verdict had seemed half-hearted,
as though gained by sympathy against men&#8217;s
harder judgment. Campion&#8217;s testimony was, so to
speak, in the air; but it had not been admitted, for
there had been no time between his wounding and his
death to find a magistrate to take his depositions.</p>

<p>Macvee had rather curled his lip at the lagging verdict.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
&#8220;What you people had better do now,&#8221; he had
said gruffly to Herriard as they gathered up their briefs,
&#8220;is to move heaven and earth to find out who did kill
Martindale. A pity for all parties Campion came to
an untimely end; I should dearly like to have had him
in that box.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is just as well for your client&#8217;s liberty and pockets
you hadn&#8217;t,&#8221; Herriard had retorted, with a laugh.
&#8220;The man and his evidence were absolutely genuine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They all are&mdash;in the solicitor&#8217;s office,&#8221; came the
cynical reply. &#8220;Anyhow, I should have liked to try a
touch of the acid&mdash;the <i>lingua fortis</i>&mdash;eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>There are men with whom it is as futile to argue as
to reason with a drunkard; men whose logic is a sneer
or a shout, whose axioms are adaptable to their line of
argument, whose postulates are taken for granted, and
whose conclusions consist, fittingly, in having the last
word.</p>

<p>Mr. Macvee went off with a self-satisfied nod, strong
in the assumption that Campion&#8217;s death was a piece of
bad luck for him, and, indeed, had lost him his case.
Herriard, when he had congratulated and taken leave
of Countess Alexia and her brother, left the Courts with
his mind full of the situation&#8217;s perplexity.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must not rest till Martindale&#8217;s murderer is
found,&#8221; he said seriously to Mr. Bowyer, the solicitor,
who, with his dapper managing clerk, was waiting for
him in the corridor.</p>

<p>Old John Bowyer pursed his lips. He was eminent
and highly respectable in his line, and his line was not
the hunting down of criminals.</p>

<p>&#8220;You think the result inconclusive, Mr. Herriard?&#8221;
asked Mr. Lee-Barker, the managing clerk, in a tone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
wherein professional deference to counsel&#8217;s opinion
hardly suggested that he had not one of his own.</p>

<p>&#8220;It must be inconclusive,&#8221; Herriard replied emphatically.
&#8220;We have won our case; so far Countess Alexia&#8217;s
reputation is cleared&mdash;legally. But she can hardly be
quite satisfied with that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite so,&#8221; observed Mr. Bowyer, in his habitual
tone of non-committal.</p>

<p>&#8220;The villain of the piece must be unmasked,&#8221; chimed
in Mr. Lee-Barker pleasantly. He had had the working-up
of the case, and was duly pleased with himself,
without being in any violent hurry to pursue it farther.
Sufficient unto the day, he told himself, is the verdict
thereof; at least, when that verdict is favourable.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; pursued Herriard earnestly, &#8220;he must be
found, and without loss of time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Lee-Barker wondered why in the world a counsel
of Herriard&#8217;s standing and ability should be so keen
outside his brief. A smart little man was Mr. Lee-Barker,
with an enviable reputation in certain circles
in Lincoln&#8217;s Inn Fields and Surbiton, where he lived;
and he believed in smartness as a paying quality, but
not in Quixotism or works of supererogation. So he
merely smiled, as deprecating zeal without instructions,
and glanced at his chief with a suggestion of getting
back to the office.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite so,&#8221; old Bowyer assented to Herriard&#8217;s urgency:
&#8220;but it is rather a matter for Scotland Yard,
is it not, Mr. Herriard?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt,&#8221; Geoffrey answered. &#8220;But they ought
to be kept up to the mark.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We can scarcely move in the matter in the absence
of instructions,&#8221; put in Mr. Lee-Barker, tempering his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
impatience with the deference due to an eminent verdict-gaining
counsel.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I suppose not,&#8221; Herriard returned, with a touch
of impatience. &#8220;I will speak to Count von Rohnburg.&#8221;</p>

<p>In his chambers Herriard threw off his wig and gown,
and sat down to review the position; Alexia&#8217;s position,
which was now, he told himself with joy, his own. He
was impatient to claim his reward; not, indeed, reward,
since his victory was its own recompense, but the fulfilment
of Alexia&#8217;s implied promise, now that the dark
cloud was driven away, that she would accept his love.
But he could scarcely present himself before her just
then; justifiable as his eagerness might be, it would not
be decent. So that evening he must not go to Green
Street; he must nurse his impatience: there was a busy
night in the House of Commons, he would spend the
hours there.</p>

<p>And Gastineau? The thought of his friend rose, for
the first time during their acquaintance, uncomfortably
to his mind. In the ordinary course he would have
called at the hidden-away house in Mayfair first of all
to report his victory. But to-day he could not bring
himself to do it. He was conscious of a feeling, the
extent of which he could not measure, which seemed
to hold him back. There would be no pleasure, but
distaste rather, in going to Gastineau&#8217;s that afternoon.
Why? His friend was unsympathetic, they were at
issue about the case: he had won it practically without
Gastineau&#8217;s assistance, and he might feel a little awkwardly
conscious on that score. The subject had been
dropped between them; still, Herriard could hardly ignore
the result, and had no wish to proclaim it. Gastineau&#8217;s
was the acuter mind, the stronger will; he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
taught Herriard almost everything by which he had
profited, and had imparted&mdash;that by force of genius&mdash;the
knack of success. To the younger man their relations
were, and probably would always be, those of
master and pupil: the stronger will, the greater determination
would always stand over the weaker. It was,
perhaps, the sign of a certain weakness in Herriard&#8217;s
character that he shrank from meeting Gastineau that
afternoon. A stronger man would have gone; Herriard
kept telling himself that he ought not to make an exception
on that of all days; and then he objected that
he would not go because Gastineau had practically declared
his belief in Alexia&#8217;s guilt. It would have been
better for him, perhaps, had he gone; however, a certain
self-consciousness and resentment kept him away, and
thereby he forged a weapon against himself.</p>

<p>In an unsettled state of mind he set himself to gather
up and put away the papers connected with the case.
Among them was a note he had taken of Campion&#8217;s last
words, his description of the man he had seen in the
hansom. &#8220;I could swear,&#8221; it ran, &#8220;that he was the
same man I saw jumping from the window at Vaux
House when Captain Martindale was killed. A dark
man, with a pale face and piercing eyes, clean-shaven,
and with straight black hair worn rather long. He
looked like a foreigner.&#8221;</p>

<p>So much Campion had told.</p>

<p>That was all. And the great question now remained,
who was the man? The description was definite enough;
nevertheless the police had come across no such person;
they were completely at a loss now, for the suspect, so
fully described, had absolutely vanished. Herriard
feared that Scotland Yard might, when baffled, relax<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
its efforts; to clear Countess Alexia, rather than to bring
the unknown to justice, it was all-important to him that
they should not.</p>

<p>He folded the note of Campion&#8217;s statement into his
pocket-book, and, on his way to the House, called upon
the Chief Commissioner, whom he knew, and urged him
to keep his men up to the mark in the hunt, and this,
the official readily assured him, should be done.</p>

<p>Next day Herriard received an invitation to dine that
evening at Green Street; he accepted it with elation,
in happy anticipation of the sealing of his betrothal.
On his way he called at Gastineau&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Luckily there were several other matters to speak of
before the awkward subject was touched upon. Herriard
could not help noticing that his friend seemed
strangely indifferent, giving points of advice and direction
almost mechanically; over the whole consultation
there was an air of unreality, of insincerity. This Herriard
was inclined, somewhat, perhaps, against his acuter
judgment, to put down to the other&#8217;s state of health.
Presently he asked Gastineau if he were suffering.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no; not particularly,&#8221; was the answer, given
with an enigmatical smile, &#8220;I am as well as I can ever
expect to be.&#8221; Then, with a swift change, &#8220;Where are
you dining to-night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At Green Street, with the von Rohnburgs,&#8221; Herriard
answered, as casually as he could.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! So you won your case yesterday.&#8221; The penetrating
eyes were upon him with their snake-like glitter.
Herriard saw, but did not meet them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; as you predicted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did I? Ah, yes. You see you did not lose much
by Campion&#8217;s disappearance from the scene.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>&#8220;I am inclined to think we did,&#8221; Herriard replied.
&#8220;We just got our verdict, and I fancy that was all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m!&#8221; Gastineau shut his thin lips significantly.
&#8220;Perhaps it is not to be wondered at. You did not
bring me the news after Court yesterday.&#8221;</p>

<p>Herriard turned now and faced the question which
lay beneath the reproach. &#8220;For two reasons,&#8221; he replied
boldly. &#8220;One, I had to hurry off to the House,
and was kept there. The Government were in a bad
way, and the opportunity had to be made the most of.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite right,&#8221; Gastineau agreed. &#8220;And reason number
two? Forgive my curiosity, but you mentioned a
second.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Reason number two,&#8221; Herriard answered, with a
short laugh, &#8220;was that I did not think you took a very
devouring interest in the case.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, my dear fellow? Why should you think that?
On the contrary, I have taken great interest in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid,&#8221; said Herriard, &#8220;our interests were
not the same.&#8221; For an instant Gastineau looked at
him searchingly, almost defiantly; then he laughed, as
he rejoined, &#8220;My dear Geof, interest is an equivocal
word. Beyond a professional attraction my only interest
is your success and advancement. In this case
I happen to hold a different opinion from yours, but
surely that need not lessen my interest.&#8221;</p>

<p>Herriard put back the thought, still it had risen to
his mind that Gastineau&#8217;s speech was not quite genuine.
The words, graceful enough in themselves, relating to
his interest in his pupil&#8217;s advancement were glibly
and perfunctorily spoken; an insincere formula, like
a doctor&#8217;s expression of sorrow at a patient&#8217;s ill-health.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyhow,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I was not particularly elated at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
what might be considered a grudging verdict, and as I
had no other news it did not seem very vital to hurry
to bring you that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; Gastineau responded coldly, his manner
plainly showing he hardly accepted the excuse as valid.
&#8220;So you are going to dine with the Countess. I hope,
my dear boy, you are not really becoming <i>&eacute;pris</i> in that
quarter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I dare say I am,&#8221; Herriard replied quietly. &#8220;But
then I hold a different opinion of her from yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gastineau lay very still, and his face was white,
deadly white. &#8220;You will regret it,&#8221; he said, just moving
his lips, in the absence or repression of all feeling;
Herriard could not be sure which.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think not; I am sure I shall never regret it,&#8221; he
returned, with conviction.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I,&#8221; Gastineau rejoined, in a stronger but still
hard, passionless tone, &#8220;am as absolutely convinced
that you will.&#8221;</p>

<p>Herriard took a step toward him, holding out his
hand. &#8220;I had better say good-night. We do not seem
likely to agree on this, and we must not quarrel.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gastineau raised a listless hand. &#8220;Good-night,&#8221; he
responded, with a brooding significance. &#8220;You will go
on your own way, then; but I have warned you.&#8221;</p>

<p>A light of vague, horrible suspicion came into Herriard&#8217;s
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gastineau,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;do you know any real
reason why I&mdash;I should take your warning?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gastineau had drawn his hand away sharply. &#8220;Nothing
in the past,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;nothing for certain, at
any rate. My only reason is my absolute certainty that
you will repent this step if you take it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>&#8220;Why should I?&#8221; Herriard demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;That I cannot tell you. It will appear soon enough.&#8221;
There seemed almost a threat behind the words.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will take my chance of that,&#8221; Herriard said, turning
to go.</p>

<p>Gastineau&#8217;s voice, sharp to peremptoriness, stayed
him. &#8220;You are going to marry the Countess Alexia?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Think so? You are engaged?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hardly. But I hope to be to-night.&#8221; Then to
soften the tone of their leave-taking he added, &#8220;I am
sorry I cannot expect your good wishes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gastineau&#8217;s face seemed set hard as a dead man&#8217;s.
&#8220;They could not be genuine,&#8221; he replied in a cold, incisive
tone. &#8220;The best wish would be that this folly
may come to nothing. And I think it will.&#8221;</p>

<p>Herriard saw the futility of saying more, so, with
just a glance at the grey face, cruel in its rigidity, he
left him.</p>

<small>NEARING A CRISIS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;MR. HERRIARD, you are not satisfied?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Countess; not altogether.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What better result could you have hoped for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None, so far as the trial went. But, for your sake,
I shall never rest satisfied till the mystery of this case
has been incontestably solved.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were sitting together in the drawing-room;
Count Prosper and an Austrian girl, who was on a
visit to England and had completed the <i>partie carr&eacute;e</i>,
were at the piano in the room beyond.</p>

<p>&#8220;The obvious solution,&#8221; Alexia said, &#8220;is the man
whom that poor fellow, Campion, saw getting out of the
window.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Undoubtedly. But we must find him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! That will be difficult?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably. The police are more or less at sea in
a case like this where the man wanted is of high social
standing, high enough, that is, to be a guest at Vaux
House. I appreciate their difficulties, but do not mean
to let them drop the search. I saw Sir Henry Ferrars
about it yesterday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How good you are,&#8221; she said, &#8220;to take all this
trouble for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For you?&#8221; He bent forward. &#8220;Could I do otherwise?
Have I not the best of reasons?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; she replied, perhaps because she
had to say something.</p>

<p>&#8220;You might know if you cared, Countess,&#8221; he said
in a low voice. &#8220;And you might tell me. I have been
happy in the thought of your promise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My promise? How well Fr&auml;ulein von Hochstadt
plays.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot hear her,&#8221; he replied, in a passionate
whisper, &#8220;when I have your voice to listen to.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alexia laughed. Her implied promise and her own
happiness disarmed her. She could but temporize with
the surrender which was not to be refused.</p>

<p>&#8220;My voice? You will shame me into silence if it
prevents your listening to the loveliest thing Tchaikovsky
ever wrote.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are,&#8221; he returned, &#8220;times when even the
genius of music must go unheeded.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In competition with the human voice?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not the voice alone, but the words we long for the
voice to speak. Alexia,&#8221; he took her hand, and to his
joy she let it rest in his, &#8220;has the time come?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The golden day, when the cloud should have passed
over and I be a free woman? Yes; thanks to you, it
has come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And for me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her silence was of consent, not doubt; at its end she
softly raised her eyes till they met his, and in that
glance, a beam that seemed to hold an eternity of
happiness, he saw that he was loved. The enchaining
melody of the great Russian master rose and thrilled
under the passionate touch of the girl at the piano; it
mingled with the perfume of Alexia&#8217;s hair, as Herriard
bent over her and pressed his lips to her cheek. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
but a snatched kiss, for they were half in sight of the
other two, but it was not to be resisted.</p>

<p>Alexia put up her hand in half-earnest warning.
&#8220;Mr. Herriard! Geoffrey! You will be seen. Will
you never learn to be opportune?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never with you, darling,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you will,&#8221; she rejoined, with a look and a
smile which tempted him to throw prudence to the
winds. &#8220;I must teach you.&#8221;</p>

<p>So he sat by her more circumspectly, engrossed in
lovers&#8217; talk. Sometimes the thought of his shame, of
his false position, would seem to force itself between
him and his love, there, where no shame should exist,
but the delight of the present hour stifled each pang of
self-reproach as soon as it was born within him. In the
intoxication of his love what mind could he have for sober
scruples? In that hour of joy it was the delight of the
present and future that held him; his past life with its
frown could but be disregarded. Looking at the rare
woman by his side, enthralled by the spell of her beauty,
above all, by the charm of her irresistibly fascinating
personality, he was not likely to allow the chilling
spectre of his deceit to stand between them. All he
could do was to look at his love and marvel at his good
fortune.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot understand,&#8221; he said, with more candour
than tact, following out the thought that was uppermost
in his mind, &#8220;how this good fortune has been
reserved for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>She glanced at him with a little smiling criticism of
his remark.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it worth while enquiring too curiously into that?&#8221;
she returned. &#8220;Perhaps the good fortune&mdash;I take your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
expression&mdash;has been reserved for the man who should
deserve it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can never,&#8221; he replied deprecatingly, &#8220;do more
than try to be worthy of it. But,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;I
was thinking, not of myself, but of the many men who
must have been in love with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed. &#8220;A very complimentary way, sir, of
alluding to the delicate subject of my age.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; he protested. &#8220;Alexia, we are neither of
us children&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And our ages are quite suitable,&#8221; she bantered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dearest,&#8221; he laid his hand on her arm with a caressing
clasp of restraint, &#8220;you know I am not alluding to age.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; she went on, still fencing, &#8220;you have
now a right to know mine; honestly, eight-and-twenty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That gives,&#8221; he said, &#8220;at least eight years of admirers.&#8221;</p>

<p>She gave a little sigh, and he thought he understood
why she had trifled with his question. &#8220;Ah, yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And, tell me, Alexia, you have never returned the
love of one of them&mdash;till now?&#8221;</p>

<p>She gave a little shrug. &#8220;Never, I suppose, till now.&#8221;</p>

<p>The last two words were almost whispered, but he
caught their thrill.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Geoffrey,&#8221; she continued, changing her
tone, &#8220;you know the world, and that there are no exact
rules for judging men, let alone women. With some
of us love is a very ordinary and regularly recurring
episode; a love affair is like a new gown, an agreeable
anticipation in the progress of its making, a shallow
joy when it is new and novel, a waning interest as it
wears out, and at last just kept on till its successor is
ready. To others,&#8221; she sank her voice, &#8220;love is fate.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>He took her hand. &#8220;Ours has come at last. May
it be a happy one. But I should have thought that
love, if not fate, had come to you before.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alexia smiled. &#8220;Why should you think so? Is it
inconceivable that a woman should not fall in love before
she is&mdash;twenty-eight?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With you,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;it is almost incredible.
Still I did not draw my conclusions from that, but
rather from your manner when I asked the question.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My manner? Was it betraying?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It seemed to suggest an <i>arri&egrave;re pens&eacute;e</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed, &#8220;Of earlier blighted affections. Hardly
complimentary to you. No,&#8221; she added, more seriously,
&#8220;I have never been in love&mdash;till now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then your sigh was the outcome of another regret;
not, I hope, that love&mdash;and fate&mdash;had overtaken you
at last?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Geoffrey, not that. You pay us both a poor
compliment.&#8221; She was speaking half dreamily, and
her voice seemed to take its tone from and blend with
the subdued melody of the andantino that came from
the inner room. &#8220;What there may be to regret comes
from others, from outside.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From men who have loved you?&#8221;</p>

<p>She made an inclination of assent.</p>

<p>&#8220;A man little thinks how painful, how hateful his
persistence is to a woman who cannot care for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Men are most selfish in love,&#8221; Herriard said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Selfish and unreasonable,&#8221; she supplemented; &#8220;some,
at least. They look upon a woman as a besieged town,
which, refusing to surrender, must be taken by assault
or battered to destruction.&#8221;</p>

<p>She spoke so feelingly that the indignant blood surged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
in Herriard&#8217;s veins. &#8220;Alexia, you have been persecuted?
Tell me: you must.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is needless,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;since it is all over
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, you mean that man, Martindale? He&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head. &#8220;No; not poor Captain Martindale.
He was tiresome, and, perhaps, something
worse. But women had spoilt him and made him what
I knew him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Alexia,&#8221; he urged, in the ardor of his new relationship.
&#8220;Tell me. I hate to think that you have
suffered at a man&#8217;s hands; I must know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not worth while,&#8221; she replied, with a little reminiscent
shudder. &#8220;It is nothing more than the persecution
of a man who had more determination than
chivalry. But he is dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lately dead?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; some years ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me his name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You would know it. He was a distinguished member
of your profession.&#8221; She paused, as though debating
with herself whether she should tell more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you ever know,&#8221; she asked at length, &#8220;did you
ever know Paul Gastineau?&#8221;</p>

<p>Simultaneously with the pronouncing of the name,
by a curious, but not uncommon prescience, the image
of Gastineau had started up in Herriard&#8217;s mind, and he
had known intuitively that no other name would be
spoken.</p>

<p>Paul Gastineau! He! That he of all men should
have been in love with her. And he had persecuted
her, evidently with such determination as to leave a
very bitter memory, enough to compel a shudder when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
it came to her mind. It was all plain now. Gastineau&#8217;s
spite was still keenly alive; love had turned to
hate. It was hate. Herriard knew it now, that had
gleamed in Gastineau&#8217;s eyes when they had spoken of
Alexia. In the same instant a great feeling of relief, of
joy almost, came to Herriard in the knowledge that the
other man&#8217;s judgment of the case had been wilfully
false. Not another doubt of Alexia&#8217;s innocence could
ever cross his mind now that he had found the opinion
of the acuter brain was warped and worthless, a mere
slander.</p>

<p>But what of the man who, for his own vindictive
purpose, had tried to poison his mind against the
woman he loved? Even across that dark thought
there streamed a ray of light. Their connection, the
equivocal nature of which had of late galled him, must
now be severed. The reason, the excuse was apt: and
he, Geoffrey Herriard, would be a free man again, to
stand or fall by his own abilities. That his marriage
would make imperative; after this disclosure the break
would be less painful; by it he would be absolved from
ingratitude towards the man who had chosen to exploit
his fortunes.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is dead,&#8221; Alexia had said, with a suggestion of
relief; and Paul Gastineau was indeed dead to all the
world save himself and Geoffrey Herriard. Could he
come to life again&mdash;Herriard did not care to imagine the
contingency except on its impossible side. It seemed
heartlessly, cruelly ungrateful, but he could not help a
feeling of subdued satisfaction at the thought that Dr.
Hallamar the one man in Europe who might have cured
him, had declared his case hopeless.</p>

<p>All this passed swiftly through Herriard&#8217;s mind as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
sat startled into the silence of intense, almost bewildering
thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;Geoffrey, what are you thinking of?&#8221;</p>

<p>The words, spoken with laughing concern, roused him
to see Alexia&#8217;s grey eyes fixed on him with perhaps a
suspicion of anxiety beneath the look of enquiry.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was wondering,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;what manner of
man it could be who had the spite to persecute you,
dearest.&#8221;</p>

<p>The animation seemed to fade from her face again.
&#8220;You may wonder,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;The man was
well known, although, I dare say, few who knew him
guessed what lay beneath the surface of his character.
I would rather you asked some one else than me to
describe him, if you are curious to revive a memory
which were better left to rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>The words seemed to stab Herriard. Who in the
world knew Gastineau better than he? Like accusing
spirits there now rose to his mind the quasi dead fighter&#8217;s
vindictive attacks on men he had hated and envied,
of which he, Geoffrey Herriard, poor tool, had been the
mouthpiece; the venomous stinging thrusts he had been
taught to deliver so deftly; the terrible, transcendent
irony and sarcasm into which he had been coached with
such untiring pains. Why should a man who had, by
a strange combination of accident and choice, taken
leave of the world, why should he retain and revel in
all this eager vindictiveness, except that his soul was
black as sin? Gastineau was a very Iago; a malicious
spirit that could not rest under the idea of denial or
disappointment, but must work for the compensating
delight of other men&#8217;s discomfiture.</p>

<p>It was terrible; more terrible still, it seemed, in that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
atmosphere of love and nobleness, where vice looked
by contrast the more hideous; and he, Geoffrey Herriard,
sitting there, with that pure hand in his, breathing
the very air of love and chivalrous devotion, had
been, and, indeed, was still, the partner, the abettor of
this son of evil. The very idea maddened him. He
recalled the look of Gastineau&#8217;s face as he had last seen
it that evening; grey, set with hate and, so far, impotent
vindictiveness. He did not like to contemplate
the picture, and, to veil it, he turned to Alexia with the
eagerness of a man escaping from a disquieting thought.</p>

<p>But she was the first to break the silence. &#8220;Does
your fate sadden you?&#8221; she asked, with a little uncertain
smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;My fate? No; certainly not my future,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;At least it makes you silent. You need not say
you were listening to the music,&#8221; she added banteringly,
&#8220;for I don&#8217;t believe you heard a note of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her woman&#8217;s instinct was right; happily, he thought,
there were limits to it. What if she could have divined
all his thoughts just then!</p>

<p>&#8220;Forgive me, darling,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;What you told
me led my thoughts to ramble among dark ways. It
is as well to explore, and then have done with them
for ever. Now I am in the sunshine again.&#8221;</p>

<p>The music had come to an end. Count Prosper and
the player joined them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can honestly say I never enjoyed music so much
before,&#8221; Herriard said, in the midst of their thanks.
&#8220;Did you, Countess?&#8221; he asked meaningly, and Alexia
was forced to say, &#8220;Never.&#8221;</p>

<p>Soon the Austrian girl took her leave. When Count<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
Prosper returned from seeing her to her carriage, he was
full of enthusiasm over her performance. &#8220;I never
heard playing that gave me as much delight,&#8221; he said,
with a touch of foreign exuberance.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never shall,&#8221; Herriard observed quietly.</p>

<p>Prosper gave him an enquiring glance; Herriard looked
at Alexia and laughed. &#8220;May I explain?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>Prosper laughed too, a little mystified. &#8220;Please do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fr&auml;ulein von Hochstadt&#8217;s playing had an added delight
for me,&#8221; Herriard said, his laugh giving way to a
little tremor of feeling, &#8220;since under cover of the music
Countess Alexia did me the honour to promise to be
my wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; It seemed not altogether unexpected by her
brother, and Herriard was glad to see no opposition
in his eyes. &#8220;So!&#8221; He bowed in acknowledgment
of the news with Austrian courtliness.</p>

<p>&#8220;My sister&#8217;s happiness is mine. Alix,&#8221; he took her
hands in his, then kissed her on both cheeks, &#8220;I wish you
joy.&#8221; He turned to Geoffrey. &#8220;Herriard, you have
my warmest wishes, and as the best of sisters should be
the best of wives, I give them with all confidence.&#8221;
He shook his hands warmly, and so it was settled.</p>

<p>As the hour was yet early, Herriard stayed for a
while longer, and Alexia kept them company in the
smoking-room. There they talked happily, laughing
over plans for the future. Alexia told her brother he
would have to find a wife now that she would be leaving
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; he objected, &#8220;I have some work to do first.
I must rise a little higher in my profession before that
comes to pass.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not likely to make an unfortunate choice,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
Count,&#8221; Herriard said, &#8220;and therefore need not pay
women a bad compliment. With a wife such as my
good fortune has given me I anticipate no drawback
in my profession.&#8221;</p>

<p>Prosper smiled. &#8220;When I have risen as high in my
service as you have in yours, my dear fellow, it will be
time for me to think about matrimony.&#8221;</p>

<p>Herriard gave a deprecating head-shake. &#8220;I have
much to do yet,&#8221; he said, with more conviction than
they gave him credit for, as he thought how he had
now to work and fight alone. &#8220;To an ambitious man,
everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>Prosper laughed again. &#8220;I am glad to see that you
are modest as well as ambitious. All the same, my
dear Herriard, it is generally admitted that you have
won for yourself a most enviable and honourable position.&#8221;</p>

<p>The word honourable grated on Herriard&#8217;s sense of
the fitting. &#8220;No! no!&#8221; he protested, with the impulsive
vehemence of awakened shame.</p>

<p>But the Count set himself to maintain the point. &#8220;A
man,&#8221; he argued, &#8220;can hardly gauge his own position.
I go about much, my dear Geoffrey, and hear what is
said of your success. Why, only this afternoon at the
Travellers, Josselyn, who you will allow knows something
of his profession and yours, was saying that you
had now quite taken the place, vacant since his death,
of one of the most successful advocates of our generation,
Paul Gastineau.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the name, Herriard and Alexia&#8217;s eyes met with
such significance that Prosper could not but notice it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, what is it? What have I said?&#8221; he demanded,
glancing from one to the other.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; his sister answered quickly. &#8220;It is curious
that we happened to mention Mr. Gastineau&#8217;s name a
little while ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are supposed to be like him in Court, Herriard,&#8221;
Prosper went on. &#8220;But with more scrupulousness
and less venom.&#8221; He laughed. &#8220;That&#8217;s what
the critics say. I don&#8217;t know how far it is a compliment.
I never heard Gastineau in Court; but I dare
say you know better than I, his reputation was not
quite such as a very honourable man would envy. He
went in to win at any price, didn&#8217;t he? and not always
to fight fair, either in law or politics, so they say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have heard that,&#8221; Herriard said, thinking of what
Alexia had told him.</p>

<p>&#8220;But he was successful,&#8221; Count Prosper continued
in the lazy discussion of a fact which a cigar induces;
&#8220;the world is dazzled by success, and in its eagerness
to applaud does not stop to ask how the success has
been won.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only a few men do that,&#8221; Alexia observed, &#8220;and
their criticism goes for little.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Herriard agreed, &#8220;in the judgment of men&#8217;s
characters, of successful men, at any rate, it is the few
who are right, the mob who are wrong. But the mob
counts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Talking of that man Gastineau,&#8221; Count Prosper
said casually, &#8220;have you heard the weird story that he
has been seen about town?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Paul Gastineau?&#8221; Herriard exclaimed. &#8220;Impossible!&#8221;
He glanced at Alexia. Her eyes were on her
brother with a look of mingled apprehension and incredulity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Prosper went on, as he blew out a long puff<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
of smoke, &#8220;it is rather startling, considering that the
fellow was killed in that railway accident near Cordova
some years ago. But the man&mdash;I have heard, but forget
who, anyhow a man who knew him well&mdash;swears
he saw him one evening lately.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a silence; for a few moments neither of
the other two could speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;Or his ghost,&#8221; Prosper added presently, puffing
lazily at his cigar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Or some one very like him,&#8221; Alexia suggested, her
eyes full of an uneasy speculation.</p>

<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; said Prosper easily, unconscious of the feeling
his announcement had excited, &#8220;is probably the
explanation. I was once absolutely deceived myself
in that way. Stopped my own cousin in the street to
find after a few words that it was not he at all, but
a total stranger. And the curious part of it was that
the man told me I was exactly like some one he knew.
So we were both deceived.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It shows,&#8221; Herriard spoke mechanically, &#8220;that
these personal resemblances are common enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; Prosper laughed, &#8220;there are only a certain
number of human moulds, and we are turned out of
one or another of them with slight variations in the
setting and the finish.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Alexia said with an effort, speaking more to
herself than to the others, &#8220;that can be the only explanation
of a man who was killed years ago in Spain,
being seen walking the London streets to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>If her tone seemed to dismiss the strange report as
easily accounted for, there was in her face a look which
Herriard did not like to see.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br />


<small>AMAZEMENT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN he left Green Street that night Herriard had
become possessed of a conviction, vague yet positive,
that the events of his life were moving swiftly
towards a crisis. How near that crisis was and what
shape it was about to take he little imagined. The
problems before him were so acute and so perplexing
that it was many hours before his brain, wearied with
the struggle, let him sleep. The joy of his love, of his
betrothal, was so mingled and interwoven with dark
and troublesome thoughts, that only intermittently
could he indulge it. One thing was certain. He must
break with Gastineau. That disingenuous partnership
could not continue. Apart from all idea of the fraud,
for to live on the credit and success derived from another
man&#8217;s brains now insistently presented itself to him
as nothing less, it was now imperative that he should
be his own master. The fortune to which he was giving
a hostage must be an honest one, of that he was determined.</p>

<p>How Gastineau would take the question of their severance
he could not be sure. The man was a contradiction,
and his character forbade the idea of accurate
forecast as to his actions. Anyhow the resolve had to
be mooted and its reception faced, unpleasant task
though it were, and the more so that on the surface it
smacked of ingratitude.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>That it should have been Gastineau of all men who
had forced his unwelcome attentions upon Countess
Alexia was a most deplorable coincidence, and with
the hateful complications it suggested there mingled
the harassing thought of the further deceit his knowledge
of Gastineau&#8217;s existence forced upon him. There,
however, he had the satisfactory excuse that his withholding
of the fact would be for Alexia&#8217;s peace of mind;
he might honourably conceal his knowledge till the disclosure
of the secret was likely to have no ill effect; and
indeed he was bound to secrecy by his solemn promise
to Gastineau.</p>

<p>He fell to thinking of the man&#8217;s character, analyzing
it by the light of what he had just heard, and told himself
he could well imagine how unchivalrously ruthless
Gastineau could be, how pitilessly he would work his
resolve in a matter where his feelings were strongly
touched. He could be, as Herriard had reason to know,
tenaciously vindictive, malignant to a degree abnormal
in human nature. Petty slights and discomfitures of
the past were remembered and brought up again with
a view to reprisal, for which, as has been seen, Herriard
was the, often unwilling, instrument. He had, however,
felt himself bound to fight Gastineau&#8217;s posthumous battles,
to be the secret champion of the man who had so
splendidly fulfilled his half of the contract, and indeed
Gastineau, when arming his pupil for the conflicts, had
always made very plausible excuses for the stinging
aggressiveness of the attacks he was planning, and had
a pleasant way of ornamenting with his wit what, divested
of flourishes, amounted to little more than gratuitous
bullying. That wit of his was the Matador&#8217;s
cloak with which he covered the deadly sword of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
invective. Happily for his own reputation Herriard,
being a man of a character very different from his mentor&#8217;s,
had been wont by a certain innate distinction and
refinement of touch to soften the ugliness of the spite
which underlay Gastineau&#8217;s methods and expressions.
Still the animus was no less real to him, and in the
present crisis was tinged by the disturbing consideration
of what that resolute mind might be capable of working
against his happiness and Alexia&#8217;s.</p>

<p>True, Gastineau in his present condition was to all
intents powerless; but could a man with a brain so
acute, so scheming, so restless, ever with safety be considered
powerless for evil? Was not that extraordinary
partnership, which had been established between them
immediately Gastineau found he was to live, proof of
what strange scheming he was capable? The whole
situation was terribly disquieting, and Herriard found
himself feverishly anxious for its solution.</p>

<p>Once or twice the strange report of Gastineau&#8217;s having
been seen about and recognized came to his mind.
It was the more curious to him in its coincidence with
the real fact of the man&#8217;s being alive; but on the whole
he attached little importance to it, being convinced it
was merely a case of mistaken identity. There were
plenty of stupid people walking the streets of London,
all ready for a mystification; and, as Count Prosper
had said, singular cases of resemblance were the experience
of nearly every one. So Herriard let that pass
without adding more than a momentary addition to his
uneasiness.</p>

<p>The next day was a busy one for him in the Courts,
and when they rose he had to hurry down to the House
on an urgent whip to wait for an important division<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
which promised to be very close. It was an annoying
delay, seeing that he had made other plans for that
afternoon. He naturally was eager to be with Alexia
again, to make amends for the snatched wooing of the
previous night; then there was Gastineau to see and
the question of their severance to be determined.</p>

<p>But it was not until evening that Herriard found
himself free to leave the House. It was then, being
about the dinner hour, too late or too early to call on
Alexia, so he drove to the outskirts of Mayfair, and
then, as was his wont, dismissing the cab, walked to
Gastineau&#8217;s.</p>

<p>His friend greeted him without a sign of the previous
night&#8217;s animosity. It was with a smile only just tinged
with cynicism that Gastineau inquired as to the result
of his wooing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Geof, is it settled?&#8221;</p>

<p>Herriard nodded. &#8220;I am sorry not to look for your
congratulations, but I am accepted.&#8221;</p>

<p>Except by a curious contraction of the eyes, a tightening,
as it were, of the muscles that govern the facial
play, Gastineau&#8217;s face betrayed no feeling.</p>

<p>&#8220;You need not be so stand-offish about it, Geof,&#8221; he
observed with a laugh. &#8220;It is extraordinary how, in
affairs of the heart, men will resent all advice and comment
on the most important event in their lives, even
from their best friends. Now, please don&#8217;t get angry,&#8221;
for Herriard had made an impatient movement; &#8220;do
remember that, if I am a hopeless cripple, I can at least
see as far into an affair of this sort, and a complex affair
it is, as yourself. I have given you my advice, unfortunately
it had to be unacceptable, and you have rejected
it, <i>voil&agrave; tout</i>.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>&#8220;It sounded yesterday,&#8221; Herriard said, with a feeling
of distaste at the reason which he knew underlay
the other&#8217;s action, &#8220;less like advice than a threat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A threat?&#8221; Gastineau drew back one side of his
mouth in a patronizing smile of protest. &#8220;My dear
fellow, you must be getting sensitive over this unfortunate
affair. How should I threaten you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The wording of the question was vague, perhaps intentionally
so. &#8220;That I cannot say,&#8221; Herriard returned
shortly, still ruffled and not caring to thrash out the
matter.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I should think not,&#8221; Gastineau rejoined, with
a little scornful laugh. &#8220;Don&#8217;t let us waste our time
in talking nonsense. It is puerile. Now, tell me about
your cases to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>He dismissed and changed the subject with the peremptoriness
of a schoolmaster dealing with a foolish
pupil. Herriard rather welcomed the tone; it would
facilitate the mooting of the important question he was
there to settle.</p>

<p>He spoke shortly of the day&#8217;s cases: they had not
been of great importance or complexity, and there was
no reason for dwelling on them. Then their talk turned
on the afternoon&#8217;s debate in the House. Gastineau
questioned him minutely, as was sometimes his wont,
about the speeches and the general conduct of the debate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why on earth didn&#8217;t you speak?&#8221; he asked presently.
There was a certain tartness in the tone of the
question which to-day Herriard rather resented.</p>

<p>&#8220;I?&#8221; he replied. &#8220;I had nothing to say. I was not
posted on the facts. Besides, they did not want me to
get up.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>&#8220;Did not want you!&#8221; Gastineau echoed impatiently.
&#8220;What had that to do with it? Your business,&#8221; he
went on testily, &#8220;is to speak when it suits you, not
when the Whips please. And as to not being posted
in the facts, surely you could have gathered them from
the opening speeches. The ineffable Congreve appears
to have been in a particularly tight corner; there was
your chance of giving the blatant ass a good kicking.
But you missed it,&#8221; he added, in a tone of disgust.</p>

<p>&#8220;Congreve got it pretty hot from all sides, as it was.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gastineau made an exclamation of impatience. &#8220;Do
you think he cared for that sort of basting? The hide
of the superior person is thicker than any donkey&#8217;s.
You must thrust through it and sting; mere drubbing
is of no use. Who went for him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Franklin and Hayland more particularly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pooh!&#8221; Gastineau returned contemptuously. &#8220;Do
you think Congreve, who, after all, has some knowledge
of men, cares for either of those? Poor old Franklin
with his academical criticisms, and Hayland who is a
snob at heart and quite ready to black Congreve&#8217;s boots
to show that his antagonism is merely of party. And
you, with this splendid opportunity to your hand, were
content to leave Congreve&#8217;s trouncing to those feeble
exponents of the art of taking the shine out of aristocratic
frauds and weaklings. Upon my word, Geoffrey
Herriard, I begin to despair of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The opening for which Herriard was waiting had presented
itself.</p>

<p>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; he returned quietly, &#8220;it would be
better that our partnership should end.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gastineau shot a searching glance at him. &#8220;You
think so?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>His fathoming, and yet unfathomable, manner was
disconcerting, but Herriard stood to his point. &#8220;We
seem to have been out of agreement lately,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;In one matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A very important one&mdash;to me, at least.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gastineau gave a little nod, and then a sneering smile
spread over his pale face. &#8220;You mean you feel you
can run alone,&#8221; he suggested, &#8220;that you can get on
without me?&#8221;</p>

<p>The tone was so cutting that it forced Herriard to
reply warmly. &#8220;That is very far from being the reason.
I am sorry that you should impute such a motive to
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gastineau laughed, still sneering. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know that
I should blame you,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When a man feels
his feet, the arm that has kept him up in deep water
becomes an encumbrance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are utterly mistaken in the motive of my suggestion,&#8221;
Herriard protested. &#8220;You have no cause to
charge me with such rank ingratitude as that would be.
The fact that I owe every step of my position to you
makes me very unwilling to propose that we should
work together no longer. Yet for some time past I
have felt that our partnership must come to an end.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can hardly offer any effective objection,&#8221; Gastineau
replied, still with the suggestion of a little quiet
scorn. &#8220;I am in your hands.&#8221; There was a subtle
touch of irony in the words. &#8220;But even now you have
not given me any adequate reason for the step, and it
seems to me that I have at least a moral right to expect
one.&#8221;</p>

<p>The whole reason could scarcely be given, and the
half seemed absurdly weak and inadequate. Still Herriard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
tried to make the most of it. &#8220;The reason,&#8221; he
answered, &#8220;is surely obvious. Our difference of opinion
respecting the woman who is to be my wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gastineau gave a shrug and a laugh. &#8220;May difference
of opinion&mdash;&mdash; You are taking the expression of
mine very seriously, my dear Geof.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can I do otherwise?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You might stop short at Quixotism.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quixotism!&#8221; Herriard echoed. &#8220;How can we work
together on the old footing with my knowledge that in
your eyes my wife is a perjured murderess?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gastineau smiled deprecatingly. &#8220;Scarcely so bad
as that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Something very like it. Your opinion is that the
Countess Alexia killed Martindale; venially, if not with
malice aforethought; and has denied on oath all knowledge
of how he came by his death.&#8221;</p>

<p>Contrary, perhaps, to Herriard&#8217;s expectation, Gastineau
made no attempt to deny or even soften the
expression of his judgment. &#8220;And so,&#8221; he said, with
a reversion to his more languid manner, &#8220;you think that
our eventful connection should come to an end?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it must,&#8221; Herriard answered, glad to bring
the disagreeable subject to finality.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well.&#8221; Then, with his peculiar smile, &#8220;But
not to-day. You are not married yet. Who knows
what may not happen before the wedding-day to modify
my disturbing opinion? The real culprit may turn
up. I hope you are searching for him; for, if I may
say so without adding to my offence, the late verdict
leaves something to be desired.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know that,&#8221; Herriard assented gloomily.</p>

<p>Gastineau nodded to emphasize the necessity.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he proceeded, &#8220;before the two halves of this
pair of shears are unscrewed we may as well make one
or two final cuts with them. I think we might get
Mr. Congreve&#8217;s aquiline nose between them while they
are yet in working condition. It is a pity you let him
off to-day when he was delivered into your hand. But
I suppose the <i>affaire</i> Rohnburg was responsible for that
too. My dear Geoffrey, haven&#8217;t I told you that a man
who would rise must keep his mind in divisions, and
never allot more room than one of them to any one
object? He must never allow the whole working to be
thrown out of gear because one engine breaks down.
Or, like a ship fitted with water-tight compartments,
if one is pierced and flooded, his mind must still be
buoyant and steerable. Yours seems now to be water-logged.
Don&#8217;t be offended. I am going to inflict you
with my maxims up to the end.&#8221;</p>

<p>Presently they parted: to all appearances not much
worse friends than ever. Herriard promised to come
again next day, and went off to call at Green Street.
He had opened the street door when it occurred to him
that it would be well for him to write a note of explanation
to leave for Alexia in case he should not find her
at home. Accordingly he shut the door again, and went
into a little study on the ground floor which he had
sometimes used for writing, when, perhaps, Gastineau
had seemed tired, and he had not cared to bore him
by staying in his room too long.</p>

<p>This room&mdash;it is as well to describe its situation in
view of what happened&mdash;was approached through an
arch, filled with a porti&egrave;re, from another and larger
apartment which was fitted as a smoking-room, for,
although Gastineau could have had little hope of using<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
it himself, it was one of his fads and fancies to have
his house perfectly appointed as a bachelor&#8217;s residence.</p>

<p>Herriard had passed into the inner room and sat
down at the writing table, switching on a shaded electric
lamp, for dusk had begun to fall and that room
was always gloomy, shut in as it was and darkened by
stained glass windows and sombre bookcases.</p>

<p>The short note was soon written. Herriard closed
the envelope, looked at his watch, and then extinguished
the lamp. It was somewhat earlier than he thought;
he did not care to present himself at Green Street till
dinner was well over. It would be as well to wait ten
minutes longer. So he sat back in the writing chair
and fell to reviewing his late interview with the man
upstairs. It was an unspeakable relief to him that he
had got over the awkward question, and had done so
with as little unpleasantness as could have been expected.
The disagreeable thought which overlay the
whole delicate business was Gastineau&#8217;s disingenuous
slander of Alexia. Had it been an honest expression of
suspicion and doubt it would have been galling enough:
being what it was, the outcome of spite, it had the natural
effect of turning Herriard&#8217;s feelings of friendship
and gratitude almost to loathing. Well, he thought,
the separation is in train now; its completion is but a
matter of days, or, at most, weeks. And then? He
fell to wondering what Gastineau&#8217;s life would be.
Would he find another friend, another partner? Very
likely he would get hold of a second apt pupil and run
him against his first. Would the new partner be primed
to attack him as he himself had been forced to attack
Congreve and other <i>b&ecirc;tes noires</i> of Gastineau? Well,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
it could not be helped; let him be thankful that the
questionable alliance had come to an end.</p>

<p>Then he thought how lonely Gastineau would be
when his own daily visits were over: and he felt sorry,
even for him, even for that restless, malicious spirit,
cruelly, yet perhaps happily, fettered, yet so keen on
working off his venom through the channel of another
man&#8217;s self-interest. Could he be really sorry for him
after what he had heard? Was not the man a danger?
Had it not been for the best&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Suddenly the current of his thoughts was arrested,
he could scarcely tell why. A moving presence near
him, or an imperfectly realized sound, was responsible
for the effect. Anyhow, Herriard straightened himself
into a posture of attention and sat listening. The
servant, Hencher, was out; Gastineau had told him
that he should be alone in the house for some hours
that evening. And yet here was&mdash;yes, the door stood
open and he could have sworn that he had heard some
one moving outside the room. He stood up and turned,
waiting. Through the opening of the curtained archway
he could see into the room beyond; the blind
was not drawn down, and the light of a street lamp
fell obliquely across the room. It was this dull stream
of light that Herriard was watching; for an instant it
had been intercepted as a dark shadow fell across it,
then it streamed uninterruptedly again. Some one,
something, was moving beyond the curtains; three steps
would solve the mystery. For a moment Herriard hesitated;
then he made a quick step forward. Only one.
For beyond the screen of the porti&egrave;re the figure of a
man appeared, moving quickly across the room until
it was again hidden by the curtain on the other side.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
A man. Who was it? The back of the figure had been
turned to him, and the light which shone into the room
fell low, leaving the head in darkness. The passing of
the figure had not broken the dead silence; was it really
a human being, or an hallucination seen by Herriard&#8217;s
excited brain, or&mdash;a supernatural visitation? These
three possibilities flashed through Herriard&#8217;s mind as
he stood dumbfounded for the moment. He held his
breath to listen more acutely. A slight sound came
from the outer room, a sound as of some small object
being moved or laid down, and Herriard told himself
that the apparition was scarcely supernatural. Then,
before the watcher could further resolve the question,
the open space was darkened again, and the mysterious
figure stood between him and the light. Herriard was
about to move forward, when the impulse changed,
and involuntarily he drew back until he was half hidden
by the angle of a bookcase by which he stood.
A strange sensation which he could not define seemed
to hold him there, without the power or the will to
move, staring intently at the man&#8217;s figure which now
seemed to be coming towards him.</p>

<p>Breathlessly, Herriard waited till the mysterious visitor
should have advanced so far out of the obscurity
that his face could be seen. In another moment the
revelation came.</p>

<p>The man had approached the opening between the
rooms; his hand was on the curtain; he pulled it aside
a little, as though glancing into the study. As he
turned his face, the light just brought it into clear
visibility. With a shock the truth came to Herriard.
The man before him was Gastineau.</p>

<small>RESURRECTION</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">HERRIARD could not have told how long the tense
situation lasted. Nor could he be sure whether
Gastineau saw him or not. The shock of the astounding
sight seemed to have deprived him of all power of
speech as well as of movement. For there was something
supernaturally mysterious about it, heightened
by the certain occult power of will, indefinable and not
to be gauged, which had always suggested itself beneath
Gastineau&#8217;s more obvious characteristics. At the same
time Herriard&#8217;s mind was alert enough, with the abnormal
activity of a dreamer&#8217;s. He wondered why
Gastineau did not speak; then whether those sharp eyes
could fail to see him; all the time searching helplessly
for a solution of the miracle of his being there on his
feet. As in a dream, the flash of time was lengthened
out, in reality Gastineau&#8217;s look into the room lasted but
two or three seconds. At length Herriard, feeling sure
he must be seen, and desperate to snap the intolerable
tension, made an effort to speak. But before his dry
tongue could utter a sound, Gastineau turned away and
disappeared.</p>

<p>With that, the rigidity that held him under a spell of
astonishment approaching to horror gradually relaxed;
the power of practical speculation returned. Was it
indeed Gastineau whom he had seen? He went forward
a few steps into the centre of the room, and listened.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
Not a sound broke the stillness. Then from the street
came that of a whistled tune. It dissipated instantly
the atmosphere of the supernatural which seemed to fill
the house. Herriard was ashamed to acknowledge the
courage which that touch of outside, common-place life
put into him. He passed boldly now into the outer
room beyond; it was empty. He went quickly out into
the hall; no one was to be seen, no movement to be
heard. Had it been really Gastineau? He was now
inclined to put the appearance down to an hallucination;
that could be plausibly accounted for in the present
perturbed state of his mind; the alternative was
beyond the bounds of possibility. At least it would
be easy to make sure.</p>

<p>Herriard ran quickly upstairs, laughing a little uncomfortably
at the absurd want of balance his brain
had shown. Next moment the shock and tremor returned.
For, in front of him, as he reached the wide
landing, the door of Gastineau&#8217;s room stood wide open.
He knew that he had shut it when he left the room
twenty minutes before. Who could have opened it if
there were no human being in the house but Gastineau
and himself? Who but one?</p>

<p>Then he laughed. Of course Hencher had returned
earlier than was expected, and had gone into his master&#8217;s
room, leaving the door open. Herriard crossed
to the room and went in. Gastineau was not there;
his couch was empty.</p>

<p>For some time Herriard stood staring at his friend&#8217;s
accustomed place stupidly, dumbfoundedly, unable all
at once to realize all the empty room meant. Then
it came to him, vaguely, but blurred as to the details,
and, following closely on that, a certain horror. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
man&#8217;s real character seemed to have been revealed to
him suddenly; he had known him intimately for years
without learning as much about him and his nature as
the last twenty-four hours had taught him. And now,
with the revelation of the depths&mdash;perhaps not yet the
lowest&mdash;of the man&#8217;s character and capabilities, had
come the startling knowledge that the chains which had
fettered that evil spirit in the flesh had been struck
off. Gastineau, then, was no longer a prisoner, but a
free man, free to work his will upon those who opposed
him, who stood in his way.</p>

<p>But the real significance of the discovery came from
the secrecy with which the change had been kept from
him. Half an hour ago Gastineau had been lying on
that couch in the manner of a hopeless paralytic; the
horror of that living lie was appalling to think of. Herriard
had often of late applied that epithet to himself:
here was the wheel within the wheel; the deceiver himself
hoodwinked; the lower depth, undreamt of, in what
he had come to think the lowest.</p>

<p>All this passed swiftly through his mind as soon as
he could bring himself to realize it; then came a more
practical consideration, Gastineau must not find him
there; must not know of his discovery of the secret.
Could he get out of the house, unseen, unheard? In
an access of consternation he stole to the door. As
his hand touched it, it was pushed open from without
and he fell back with a half cry as Gastineau stood
before him.</p>

<p>The face he encountered was dark with vicious ill-humour;
but, if he was more startled than Herriard by
the rencontre, he, with his stronger nerves, showed it
less. The expression of angry surprise changed into a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
sneering, evil laugh of annoyance, the laugh of a schemer
who is found out.</p>

<p>It was characteristic of him that he waited for Herriard
to speak. The explanation was due not from,
but to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gastineau, you are well, you are cured?&#8221; There
was contempt now in the laugh with which the other
walked past him into the room.</p>

<p>Herriard turned and faced him. &#8220;Gastineau,&#8221; he
said, wondering apprehensively what was to come,
&#8220;why did you not tell me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gastineau turned too; the look of surprised annoyance
had given way to a smile which was not exactly
reassuring. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he replied coolly; &#8220;I have recovered
the use of my limbs&mdash;no thanks to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The light tone in which the last words were spoken
did not disguise their intentional significance. To Herriard
they were obscure, and he let them pass.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Gastineau, why this secrecy?&#8221;</p>

<p>The other man&#8217;s mouth was drawn to one side in a
sneer. &#8220;Could you expect anything else?&#8221; he returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely,&#8221; Herriard answered quite frankly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know whether you kept it secret to give me a pleasant
surprise,&#8221; he added, with a touch of irony.</p>

<p>&#8220;A pleasant surprise!&#8221; Gastineau repeated the
words with an incredulous drawl.</p>

<p>&#8220;You might have known how rejoiced I should be
at your recovery.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gastineau laughed unpleasantly. &#8220;You know how
wrong-headed I am apt to be. I might have doubted
even your satisfaction.&#8221;</p>

<p>Herriard looked at him in wonder at the line he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
was taking. &#8220;You do me less than justice,&#8221; he protested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I?&#8221; the other replied meaningly. &#8220;Well, perhaps
I may be excused for imagining you would just as
soon that things remained as they were. It is scarcely
worth discussing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it is,&#8221; Herriard maintained.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; Gastineau denied with decision. &#8220;I am
ready to accept your assurance that you are pleased at
my recovery,&#8221; he continued, in an off-hand tone. His
manner of almost vicious irritation had disappeared.
It was now easy and, but for a lurking suspicion of
spite, almost pleasant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I am,&#8221; Herriard assured him, with a show
of greater conviction than perhaps he felt. &#8220;Tell me
how it has come to pass?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gastineau took out a cigarette and lighted it. &#8220;There
is nothing much to tell; I have, as you know, a strong
constitution and a still stronger will. First of all, let
me tell you, since you have found out what it amused
me to keep secret&mdash;by the way, I thought you left the
house some time ago?&#8221; He spoke sharply, as though
accusing Herriard of a trick.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was half out of the house,&#8221; he hastened to explain,
&#8220;but came back to write a note. I was in the
study when you came downstairs, and could not believe
my eyes when I saw you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And came up here to see whether I was my own ghost
or not?&#8221; Gastineau supplemented with his quick perceptiveness.
Herriard nodded. &#8220;Well, there is no harm
done, except, perhaps, so far as my own plan of life may
be affected. Now, although the conditions are changed, I
wish my being alive to be kept as close a secret as ever.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; Herriard responded. &#8220;You may trust
me not to breathe a hint of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To any one?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To any one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not even to your <i>fianc&eacute;e</i>, Countess Alexia?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; not even to her.&#8221; To Alexia least of all, he
thought.</p>

<p>Gastineau smoked in silence for a few seconds, inhaling
the smoke slowly, as though formulating a plan of
explanation. &#8220;I am like a man newly risen from the
dead;&#8221; he spoke deliberately with a curious tenseness;
&#8220;or rather, like one born in manhood instead of infancy.
Life has come upon me so suddenly, so unexpectedly,
that I am bewildered. I cannot look ahead yet, cannot
order my existence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can understand that,&#8221; Herriard commented.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whether to go back to the old life,&#8221; Gastineau continued
musingly, yet characteristically alert; &#8220;or to
start an entirely new one, to carve out a fresh career;
to conquer another world, rather than to throw myself
again into the old arena with its sordid dust, its contemptible
applause? That is the question,&#8221; he raised
his tone, &#8220;to go back to the wrangling, the quibbling,
the stench of the Courts, the knocking of sense into and
prejudice out of the butchers&#8217; skulls of twelve greasy
tradesmen, the blunting of one&#8217;s wits against the Judge&#8217;s
shield of complacent stupidity and short-sightedness, the
disgusting obligation to win a ruffian&#8217;s or a sharper&#8217;s
fight against a decent fellow; to be jostled all day by
glib, shabby lawyers&#8217; clerks, reeking of cheap cigarettes
and bristling with impudence: to be at the beck and
call of any swindler who wants to ply his trade with
impunity, fortified by counsel&#8217;s opinion; then to go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
down to the House of Commons as special pleader for
a bill which one knows is to rob one class in order to
bribe another; to bustle through life with an axe to
grind, and to cajole every useful fool into acting as a
grindstone, faugh! is it worth it, all over again? No;
I feel I must fill my new lungs with a fresher atmosphere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You forget the rewards, Gastineau,&#8221; Herriard said,
wondering how far the other was in earnest; &#8220;the rewards
which were admittedly within your reach.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rewards!&#8221; he burst out contemptuously. &#8220;Fancy
me a Judge. How long do you think my tongue, my
spirit, would let me sit on the Bench? The Woolsack,
which my flatterers promised me, do you see me there?
Could I school myself to prose and mouth, and stage-manage
the mummery of their Lordships&#8217; House? No,
Herriard. This is a new birth of mine. I may drift
back to the old trade; but if my heart was ever in it&mdash;which
I doubt&mdash;it will never be there again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;After such an indictment of a vocation which is
mine too,&#8221; Herriard observed, with a doubtful smile,
&#8220;it is perhaps as well that our offensive alliance is coming
to an end.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gastineau glanced at him sharply, as though in search
of a lurking sarcasm. &#8220;The intellectual side of our profession,
as it should be, is one thing,&#8221; he said quietly;
&#8220;the practical scrimmage, as it is, is quite another. It
has amused me to help you, to have something of the
fight without any of the dust. Now&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he gave a
significant shrug, and lighted another cigarette.</p>

<p>To Herriard it seemed unwise to pursue the delicate
subject further. It was evident that his release from
the partnership was forthcoming, and that was his great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
desire. &#8220;You have not explained the mystery of your
recovery,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>There was what seemed an uncalled-for sneer in Gastineau&#8217;s
off-hand reply. &#8220;I scarcely thought it would
interest you. However, I may tell you I owe my cure
to Dr. Hallamar.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dr. Hallamar?&#8221; Herriard cried in surprise. &#8220;Why,
you told me he declared he could do nothing for you.&#8221;
Gastineau gave a sharper&#8217;s laugh at his gull&#8217;s remonstrances.
&#8220;Nor could he then,&#8221; he returned, &#8220;seeing
that the work was done, the cure effected.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What, before I spoke of him to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just so,&#8221; Gastineau replied mockingly, &#8220;before you
spoke of him to me. When that happened my cure
was on the eve of completion. If it suits you to shut
your eyes, my dear friend, it is to my advantage to
keep mine open.&#8221;</p>

<p>Herriard could not be certain whether the suggestion
was meant that he had wilfully shut his eyes. He hated
the thought that there was near being a grain of truth
in the suspicion, if such it were. &#8220;I am glad,&#8221; he said
simply, &#8220;that my stupid indifference to Hallamar&#8217;s work
and fame was counteracted by your vigilance. I admit
that my ignorance was inexcusable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It made no difference,&#8221; Gastineau replied with cold
brevity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Happily.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, don&#8217;t let me keep you. You are going to the
Countess?&#8221;</p>

<p>The words were snapped out; their viciousness
scarcely covered by the affectation of half-contemptuous
indifference which Gastineau assumed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>&#8220;But my resurrection has surprised you into neglecting
even that agreeable duty. I don&#8217;t wonder. My
restoration to bodily activity is full of startling possibilities.
By the way, I think you said you were seriously
engaged to the Countess?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Seriously. Of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In spite of my warning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which I fear I cannot act upon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, well, we shall see.&#8221; Gastineau went over to a
writing table, seated himself and took up a pen. &#8220;You
will come and see me to-morrow evening,&#8221; he said,
without turning. But for the inflection, which was interrogative,
the tone suggested a command. &#8220;I may
have something important and definite to say to you
then. At present my plans are not formulated.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; Herriard replied, troubled and doubtful.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will not fail? Good-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked round and nodded smilingly, then turned
back to his writing. Herriard, with a strangely uncomfortable
feeling, bade him good-night, and left him.</p>

<small>HERRIARD STANDS ALONE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ONCE outside the house, the tension at which Herriard&#8217;s
nerves had been strung during that surprising
interview relaxed, and a whirl of troubling,
anxious thoughts crowded to his mind. He seemed
suddenly plunged from light into darkness; just as he
seemed to be making harbour to be carried back upon
an angry sea. He felt he was in no condition then to
see Alexia; she would surely detect from his manner
that something was wrong, and, unhappily, he was debarred
from all explanation of his trouble. The lateness
of the hour afforded him some excuse for not presenting
himself; perhaps on the morrow his mind would
be clearer and he more master of himself. As it was,
just then he felt he must think, resolve and resolve again
the problem, presented so threateningly, of Gastineau&#8217;s
persecution of Alexia, coupled with his recovery.</p>

<p>How did he, Geoffrey Herriard, stand in the matter?
What part was he to play? What was his course, for
Alexia&#8217;s sake, to be? At present his position was clear.
He stood between Gastineau and the object of his desire.
At which of them would that subtle, resolute,
relentless spirit strike first; at him or her? That could
with no certainty be forecasted; Gastineau&#8217;s mind did
not move in men&#8217;s common grooves of thought and
action. He knew that well enough, and that the essence
of his quondam tutor&#8217;s aggressive tactics was surprise.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
To know when to hit and where to hit had been his
rule; he was wont to strike quickly and from the least
expected side. It seemed pretty certain, so far as anything
could be foreseen, that he would strike at Alexia.
Altogether, the problem seemed so complex that Herriard
was convinced that its ultimate solution must lie
in its own developments. He was dealing with an abnormal
character, and all he could do was to keep warily
on his guard. Whichever way he looked at the situation
his position was hateful; but it was one from which,
for Alexia&#8217;s sake, he could not flinch.</p>

<p>So, after a perturbed pacing of one of the Park&#8217;s
outer walks, he turned his steps towards his rooms in
Mount Street. Abandoning the riddle of the future,
his thoughts rested on the past. Now he understood
why on two chance occasions Gastineau had been denied
to him. He had been at the moment probably undergoing
secret treatment at the hands of Dr. Hallamar.
And the thousand pounds of which Gastineau had suddenly
found himself in need: that sum was surely to
make up the great surgeon&#8217;s fee. Now it was plain why
Gastineau had himself insisted on writing what had
purported to be a note of invitation to Dr. Hallamar
to see him, and had sent it off without giving Herriard
a sight of it. In effect it must have been an injunction
to the Doctor not to divulge even to his patient&#8217;s
friend that the cure was already effected. Yes; one
after another, little incidents occurred to Herriard, who,
having now the key of the puzzle, fitted them in convincingly.
And so the night passed.</p>

<p>Next day he snatched an hour between the rising
of the Courts and a consultation to go to Green
Street.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>&#8220;And I expected you every hour yesterday,&#8221; Alexia
said reproachfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;You had my note?&#8221; he replied. &#8220;Had I known
I was to be kept all day it should have been sent earlier.
But I expected, as you did, that every hour would
bring me here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Were you really so busy?&#8221; she asked, still unsatisfied.
&#8220;From early morning, till late at night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, on my honour, dearest; busy and worried.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, worried?&#8221; she repeated almost wistfully.
&#8220;Does a man ever have worries that can be shared?&#8221;</p>

<p>He shook his head with a smile. &#8220;Business worries.
How can a woman share them? Yet every day must
bring them if a man is conscientious in his work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes; I understand.&#8221; She laid her hand caressingly
on his arm. &#8220;I shall always be proud of you and
of your work, Geoffrey. I can guess how you must
have worried for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Naturally.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, but that is over,&#8221; she said brightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope so,&#8221; he replied, forcing his tone to match
hers. &#8220;Both my worries about you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Both?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That I might lose your case, and that you might
refuse me.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a beam of love-light in her eyes as she
replied, &#8220;One of your worries would have been superfluous
if I could have refused you, Geoffrey. Don&#8217;t
look mystified. Should I have been worth worrying
about if I were incapable of appreciating all you are and
all you have done for me?&#8221;</p>

<p>The unconscious irony of the words seemed to stab
him. &#8220;So little compared with what I should have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
done,&#8221; he murmured; &#8220;so far from what I should
be.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alexia laughed protestingly. &#8220;My dear Geoffrey,
you are abnormally, unreasonably modest. That the
world does not take you at your own valuation is lucky
for you, and the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it is lucky, at least for me. Perhaps
if you took me at my own valuation you would not
look at me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Geoffrey!&#8221; she protested. There is a point beyond
which the self-abasement of the man she loves begins
to jar on a woman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alexia,&#8221; he continued, clasping her hands in his,
&#8220;you do love me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Geoffrey,&#8221; she answered frankly, as her deep
grey eyes looked into his. &#8220;You know I love you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you hardly know me,&#8221; he went on. &#8220;At least
only as the world knows me, from the show-side. If,
when we are married and you know me almost as I
know myself, if then you find I am not all you thought
me, if you find that what you call my modesty was not
all affectation, that I stand lower in your estimation
than I once did, will you love me then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will love you always, Geoffrey,&#8221; she answered
simply. &#8220;Do you think a woman is ever very wrong
in her estimation of a man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where love and, perhaps, gratitude are concerned
to blind her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alexia laughed. &#8220;Sometimes, where the woman is
a fool. I don&#8217;t think I am a fool, dear, or that you
are unworthy of all I believe you to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ah, that miserable secret that lay between them.
Could he, dared he, tell her that all through the brilliant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
career for which she admired him he had been but the
mouthpiece of a cleverer brain, and that man, of all
others, Paul Gastineau? Yet if the confession were to
come at all it should in honour be made forthwith.
Every hour he delayed it added lie to lie. Yesterday
he had thought the truth of the matter need never be
spoken, to-day he felt that the disclosure must sooner
or later be forced upon him. And if it was so surely
to come, Alexia must at any cost learn the truth from
his lips, not from another&#8217;s, least of all Gastineau&#8217;s.
Yet he recognized that their secret was Gastineau&#8217;s
weapon to crush Alexia&#8217;s love for him. How long
would it be before he made his existence, his presence
known to the woman of his desire; how long before he
dealt that telling blow? He ought to forestall him;
here, to his hand, was the opportunity. Yet, could he
take it? It meant, he told himself, breaking his oath to
Gastineau; it would mean trouble and fear to Alexia,
it might mean his own discomfiture and ruin. No. At
that moment with his arms round Alexia, with her sweet
eyes speaking love to his, with her kisses on his lips,
he could not give even a hint that should mar the delight
of the present. The future seemed dark enough:
the light of his love should burn till its extinction was
forced upon him.</p>

<p>He looked at Alexia, the prize he had won, radiant
in the beauty that was for him, and which was the index
of a glorious soul. The thought of Gastineau&#8217;s insinuation
against this adorable woman filled him with an
access of disgust. What lie could ever lurk beneath
the light of those clear grey eyes, which looked into
his with a gaze which shamed the good fortune he had
seized under the shadow of falsehood. Is not the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
charm of a woman of honour compared with the Circean
fascination of an adventuress as sunlight to darkness?
The spell of Alexia&#8217;s beauty was upon Herriard;
and not of her beauty only, but of the innate nobility
which differentiated her in his eyes from every other
woman. He clasped her to him with passionate kisses,
and in his heart vowed, that, cost what it might, the
whole world should not take this prize from him; not
the forces of right; no, nor the legions of evil, whose
well-chosen representative in this case seemed to be
Paul Gastineau.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not have you disparage yourself to me, dear,&#8221;
Alexia said presently. They were standing lover-like,
with hands clasped; the time of parting had come, for
it was near the hour of Herriard&#8217;s appointment in chambers.
&#8220;You must not,&#8221; she continued, with her love
radiating through the playful reproof. &#8220;It reflects on
my taste, when you run yourself down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I will not,&#8221; he replied, abandoning himself
to the moment&#8217;s rapture. &#8220;Henceforth I will be what
you would have me.&#8221; And he vowed inwardly that
he would never for a scruple risk the loss of this jewel;
would never be fool enough to ring the doubtful coins
he was giving for it that they might sound false.</p>

<p>In a few minutes he was, still in the exaltation of this
wondrous love that he had found, speeding away to a
common-place, sordid consultation in a company case.
What contrasts the world holds, he thought; and suddenly
found himself heartily in agreement with Gastineau&#8217;s
late indictment of their profession. It was difficult
to bring his mind down from that seventh heaven
to the mundane level of advising a knot of greedy
money-grubbers how to avoid a certain disgorgement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
of undue profits which threatened them. For the time
hating and despising a profession which made him, the,
nominally honourable, adviser of dishonest men, he kept
himself rigidly from all show of sympathy with the sharp
practitioners who sat before him; and held, without a
suggestion of helpfulness to the dry questions of law
which were involved. And when the smart solicitor
had carried off his dissatisfied clients, arguing with glib
tenacity the chances of law versus equity, he threw himself
back in his chair with a sigh of unutterable relief
that the air of the room was purer, and that he could
indulge the delight of his new-found happiness.</p>

<p>Then a troublesome thought arose to check the delight
of his reverie, his immediate interview with Gastineau,
the time for which was almost come. He
remembered how Gastineau had practically ordered
him to attend that evening. It was galling; behind
the distastefulness was, perhaps, a touch of apprehension.
And indeed a brave man may be excused fear
of the methods of an unscrupulous opponent. It is
fighting in the dark, and courage may well fail where
it can avail nothing. Still, with all his reluctance to
meet Gastineau under their altered relationship, Herriard
was glad to think that the projected interview
might also show him where he stood: he might, though
it was unlikely, get an inkling of Gastineau&#8217;s plans, and
whether he intended to resume his pursuit of Alexia.
That he was feverishly anxious to know, since on it
depended the question whether or not he was to be
involved in a terribly unequal struggle with a man of
abnormal cunning and determination. Yes; if it were
to come, it was as well that it should come at once;
suspense was unbearable.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>Herriard rose and prepared to go out. He would
dine at a restaurant near at hand, then start off for
Mayfair and get the business over. As he opened the
door of his chambers a man stood outside who raised
his hat and addressed him by name.</p>

<small>THE SOLUTION OF THE MYSTERY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;I &nbsp; WAS just coming to see you, Mr. Herriard, from
Sir Henry Ferrars.&#8221;</p>

<p>He handed his card, &#8220;Detective Inspector Quickjohn,
New Scotland Yard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, come in,&#8221; Herriard said, leading the way back
to his room, and closing the door. &#8220;Have you any
news for me, Inspector?&#8221;</p>

<p>Inspector Quickjohn took the indicated seat and pulled
out a large note-book, the orthodox preliminary to police
communications. He was a rather smartly dressed man
with a curious absence of any professional stamp upon
him: he had an unobtrusive manner, quiet almost to
dulness, only relieved by the alert, uncompromising eyes
and a general suggestion of unflinching power.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Mr. Herriard,&#8221; he answered, with legal deliberation,
as he ran through the leaves of his note-book,
&#8220;I have certain information which the Chief Commissioner
has instructed me to give you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes?&#8221; Herriard leaned forward with eager
attention.</p>

<p>But Inspector Quickjohn was an important man, and,
withal, a smart, acute officer, who, with his twenty years&#8217;
training, was incapable of blurting out anything. If he
had discovered another Gunpowder Plot he would not
have imparted the information without a due amount of
witness-box preliminaries and professional garnishing.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>&#8220;You see, sir,&#8221; he preambled, in the logical method
of a Scotch sermon, &#8220;the Chief Commissioner some time
back placed the Vaux House case in my hands, and I
have made a specially careful study of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Herriard nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will understand, sir,&#8221; Mr. Quickjohn went on,
holding his note-book half-closed, with his thumb in
the place to which he would in his own good time refer,
&#8220;it is a very difficult, intricate case; one of the most
baffling I remember.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt. But you have found out something?&#8221;
Herriard suggested.</p>

<p>Mr. Quickjohn was not to be bustled. He raised his
hand in a deferential appeal for patience.</p>

<p>&#8220;The question as to who the person was at whose
hands the late Captain Martindale met his death has
given me a rare lot of trouble. You see, Mr. Herriard,
it was so long ago, and there was, if I may say so, such
a crowd to choose from.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just so,&#8221; Herriard put in, forcing back the expression
of his growing impatience.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Prim&acirc; facie</i>,&#8221; continued the Inspector reflectively,
&#8220;<i>prim&acirc; facie</i>, I should not have troubled to look beyond
the Countess Alexia von Rohnburg.&#8221;</p>

<p>The declaration brought a great relief to Herriard.
Somehow there had been in his mind a vague dread
that the detective might have found some plausible
reason for bringing the matter home to Alexia.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; he said quickly and with decision. &#8220;The
Countess knew nothing of the affair.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Quickjohn felt called upon to justify his former
attitude.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was a good colourable <i>prim&acirc; facie</i> case,&#8221; he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
maintained, with a manner which claimed that his long
and eventful experience entitled to respect any theory
to which he thought proper to commit himself. &#8220;You
must recollect, Mr. Herriard, the lady in question was
the last person known to have been with the deceased
before his death was discovered; then there was the
finding of the little dagger with which the crime must
have been committed, and the evidence of the maid,
Gibson, that the Countess had worn it as an ornament
in her hair that evening. Then&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>It was more than Herriard could stand. &#8220;Yes, yes,
Mr. Quickjohn,&#8221; he interrupted impatiently, &#8220;we know
all about that. I admit there was ground for a <i>prim&acirc;
facie</i> suspicion. But I and, presumably, you, know
now that the Countess was not cognizable of Captain
Martindale&#8217;s death. However, you have not come to
tell me that? You have found the man&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Quickjohn raised his thick hand in protest. He
liked to give his evidence in his own way, and judged
leading questions unnecessary and a mistake. He was
perhaps rather surprised that a counsel of Herriard&#8217;s
standing should not know better than to try and hurry
him. &#8220;I have,&#8221; he replied, with marked deliberation
and a suggestion of touched dignity, &#8220;I have, after careful
sifting of the materials at my disposal, made a discovery
and, I think, arrived at a satisfactory settlement
of the question as to the identity of the person at whose
hands the Captain met his death.&#8221;</p>

<p>Herriard, seeing his mistake, now merely nodded him
on.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, sir,&#8221; Quickjohn proceeded, in his more
business-like, witness-box manner, &#8220;the difficulty has
been in searching for a person answering the description<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
among the whole list of the Duchess of Lancashire&#8217;s
guests. There were four hundred and forty-two noblemen
and gentlemen invited to Vaux House that night,
and no record available of those who attended, those
who were absent, or those who may have been there
uninvited.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Herriard commented, &#8220;you had a difficult
task.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and no mistake,&#8221; Quickjohn agreed, &#8220;and
I am prepared to admit that if it had not been through
a mere chance, I should never have been able to put
my finger on the right individual.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The clue came through the deceased man Campion,
who was to have given evidence in the late trial. An
unfortunate occurrence, Mr. Herriard, Campion&#8217;s fatal
accident,&#8221; Quickjohn observed, in a tone of parenthetical
regret; &#8220;more particularly as it was occasioned by
an absolutely mistaken act on his part.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How so? What do you mean?&#8221; Herriard asked,
in some surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, sir, my meaning is this,&#8221; Quickjohn answered
deliberately, with the superiority of one who is sure of
his facts; &#8220;it will be within your recollection that the
deceased man, Campion, deposed before he died that
the accident happened as he was running in pursuit of
a hansom in which was a man whom he asserted he had
recognized as the party he had seen leaving Vaux House
under suspicious circumstances on the night of Captain
Martindale&#8217;s alleged murder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Mr. Herriard,&#8221; pursued Quickjohn, with an
air of infinite witness-box wisdom, &#8220;the late Campion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
was quite mistaken in thinking he had recognized his
man in that hansom. He could not possibly have done
so, seeing that the party whom Campion had seen escaping
from Vaux House on the night in question has
been dead some years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know that?&#8221; Herriard asked mechanically,
uncertain whether to be relieved or disappointed.</p>

<p>Quickjohn nodded. &#8220;Met his death shortly after the
Vaux House affair. So it stands to reason that he could
not have been the party whom Campion saw in the
hansom.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Naturally. And who,&#8221; Herriard asked, with intense
curiosity, &#8220;was the man we have been in search
of, and who, you say, is dead?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Quickjohn liked to tell his stories in his own
way, and considered he had earned the privilege of
doing so. &#8220;Well, sir,&#8221; he responded, with irritating
deliberation, &#8220;it is very curious how, as every detective
knows, the merest accident will often put one on the
right scent. And what I have to tell you now, sir,
is the result of a chance remark which fell from the late
Campion. It was this way. When we heard at the
Yard that he had appeared on the scene, and we knew
something of what his evidence was to be, I, having
charge of the case, which, on the discovery of the little
weapon at Vaux House, had been placed in my hands,
thought it well to have a private interview with Campion
on my own account. You see, Mr. Herriard, if
the Countess was innocent it was our business to find
the guilty party. So I got hold of Campion and asked
him to come up to my place one evening and talk the
matter over quietly. He comes over to Brixton and
I got from him everything that could be of the slightest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
use in working-up the case. You see, Mr. Herriard,&#8221;
he diverged again tantalizingly, &#8220;the questions we should
put are very different from those the solicitors ask; we
look at the case from a working point of view. It was
my object to get an idea whether the man Campion saw
leaving by the window was a gentleman, likely to have
been a guest, or a flash operator working the function
for what he could pinch in the way of jewellery, plate,
etc.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve known such cases,&#8221; Mr. Quickjohn resumed,
with a dangerous approach to reminiscence which happily
passed off. &#8220;However, I was pretty satisfied, after
putting a number of searching questions, that the party
I had to look for was not one of the criminal classes,
but in all probability, a <i>bona fide</i> guest. Now, a curious
thing happened, Mr. Herriard, which I didn&#8217;t think
much of at the time, though it occurred to me afterwards
to follow up the clue. We were sitting there in
my parlour over a cigar and a glass of grog, and I was
drawing Campion out, trying him backwards and forwards
to get everything he could tell me of the man&#8217;s
appearance and manner. Well, we were sitting, as I
say, in my parlour, and I&#8217;ve a lot of photos put about
there, portraits of Judges and well-known counsel that
I&#8217;ve come in contact with in various cases,&mdash;I&#8217;ve a
framed sketch of yourself, Mr. Herriard, done in Court
by a friend of mine clever with his pencil&mdash;well, I was
worrying Campion about the very minutest details of
this man&#8217;s appearance, when suddenly he caught sight
of a photo on the wall, and he says, &#8216;There,&#8217; he says,
&#8216;the chap I saw had a face just like that, and if that
isn&#8217;t the man&mdash;&mdash;&#8217; I jumped round in my chair and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
looked to where he was pointing. &#8216;That,&#8217; I said, &#8216;that&#8217;s
not exactly our man, my friend, although, it is curious,
I&#8217;ve never seen another face like that. That is the
late Mr. Paul Gastineau, K.C., M.P.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Herriard sprang up from his chair as though shot.
&#8220;Gastineau!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Quickjohn nodded several times with a suggestion
of infinite sagacity and astuteness. &#8220;That&#8217;s the
party, sir: although I laughed at the idea at first.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gastineau!&#8221;</p>

<p>Herriard&#8217;s excitement surpassed any effect Mr. Quickjohn
had anticipated. It was altogether more than he
could account for in a member of an even-blooded profession.
&#8220;Strange discoveries we light upon sometimes,&#8221;
he remarked sententiously. &#8220;To think that a
man in the position of Mr. Paul Gastineau could be the
party wanted. I can well understand, sir, you can&#8217;t
believe it at the first blush. Let me tell you how I arrived
at my conclusions.&#8221;</p>

<p>Herriard did believe it. Somehow he felt he wanted
no proof. The charge, monstrous till suggested, seemed
to fit exactly: nothing now could disprove it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, tell me,&#8221; he said, recovering himself by an effort
as he sank down to his chair and turned his strained
face toward his visitor.</p>

<p>In characteristic matter-of-fact fashion Mr. Quickjohn
accepted the invitation and proceeded.</p>

<p>&#8220;As I say, I had no idea of putting two and two
together at first. My only conclusion was that if the
party wanted had a singular face, anything like the
late Mr. Gastineau&#8217;s, he would be easily recognized&mdash;if
I could only come across him. Of course I made a
note of the similarity, and Campion soon after left me.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
Well, sir, I didn&#8217;t see much chance of running across
Mr. Gastineau&#8217;s double, for such Campion declared his
man was; however, I pegged away at the case and, after
a lot of trouble, got a full list of the gentlemen guests
invited to Vaux House on the occasion in question.
Dukes and duchesses are not the easiest people in the
world to deal with, as you may be aware, Mr. Herriard.
They seem to think their position puts them above taking
reasonable trouble or interest in anything. They
want things done by magic and won&#8217;t see that our
methods at the Yard are not exactly those of the Arabian
Nights. Well, I did get the list, and, on looking
down it and wondering how long it would take me to
find out which of four hundred and forty odd noblemen
and gentlemen most closely resembled Mr. Gastineau,
K.C., M.P., what should I come to but that very same
gentleman&#8217;s name. As I read it, the idea seemed to
strike me in a flash, not merely why mightn&#8217;t he have
done it after all, but that he had done it. Merely a
conjecture, true, but I set to work on it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that conjecture would be a long way from the
proof,&#8221; Herriard observed, with certainty already in
his mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Naturally,&#8221; assented Mr. Quickjohn, &#8220;and moral
proof is often far from legal evidence. However, I may
say I have succeeded, after a lot of work, in obtaining
corroborative evidence which brings home the crime,
circumstantially at least, to the late Mr. Gastineau.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes? Tell me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The affair took place a long time ago,&#8221; Quickjohn
proceeded, &#8220;and it is, as you know, sir, difficult to get
men to carry their memories back over several years
to remember circumstances important enough to us,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
trivial to them. However, I have succeeded in tracing
a man, one of the Duke&#8217;s extra footmen he was, who
distinctly recollects a gentleman answering to Mr. Gastineau&#8217;s
description coming into the house without a
hat or overcoat. The time of night would fit in with
that of Captain Martindale&#8217;s death. The man I speak
of took Mr. Gastineau for a late arrival, and wondered
where he had come from without a hat. His coat he
might have left in his carriage or even come without
one, as it was a warm night. That fixed him in the
man&#8217;s mind, but on these occasions there is too much
bustle to give attention long to anything, and he thought
no more about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a good piece of evidence,&#8221; Herriard remarked
mechanically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Mr. Quickjohn agreed, with a touch of self-satisfaction.
&#8220;But I go farther, sir. I have also established
the fact that Mr. Gastineau left Vaux House
shortly afterwards, having obtained his hat and overcoat
from the cloak-room, the overcoat being a grey
colour, such as the late Campion deposed to as worn by
the man he saw the second time. Now, Mr. Herriard,&#8221;
the Inspector with a click put the elastic band round
his note-book, which, by the way, he had not referred
to, &#8220;that&#8217;s as far as I have got at present, but it seems
to me pretty conclusive evidence as far as it goes, and
the Chief Commissioner thought you might like to know
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed; thank you, Inspector,&#8221; Herriard responded,
indulging the thought of how little the astute
officer guessed of the real import to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said that officer, pocketing his book,
&#8220;the case is not complete, not nicely rounded off, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
I hope to have it before it&#8217;s done with. There is a
link missing in the chain, as no doubt you perceive, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>Herriard did indeed know it, and that he could, if
he would, supply it.</p>

<p>&#8220;The motive?&#8221; he suggested casually.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it, sir,&#8221; said Quickjohn. &#8220;If I can only
discover that Mr. Gastineau and Captain Martindale
had not been on the best of terms, had had a difference,
say about a lady, that would make the case against the
late Gastineau perfect.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you any chance of finding that?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Quickjohn looked inscrutably wise. &#8220;I am in
hopes of doing so. But that will mean setting to work
in quite a fresh direction.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have no clue as yet?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Quickjohn rose. As an artist he cared to show
only his finished work, and this was scarcely more than
blocked in.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have several sources of information to tap,&#8221; he
replied vaguely, &#8220;but nothing to report as yet. Well,
I&#8217;ll say good evening, Mr. Herriard. I thought you
might be interested to hear I had put my finger on the
party, if one may say so of a deceased man. I&#8217;m only
sorry the party is not alive,&#8221; he went on, with a suspicion
of jocularity. &#8220;It would have been a big sensational
case and would have made my fortune in the
profession. There&#8217;s all the difference between a big crime
in the upper classes and the same in the lower as there
is between, you may say, the Royal Opera at Covent
Garden and a nigger with a banjo outside a public-house.
Still I hope what I have so far cleared up will
be satisfactory to you and your late client. Good evening,
sir.&#8221;</p>

<small>THE MASK FALLS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE door had closed upon Inspector Quickjohn,
and Herriard sat motionless, as though dazed
by this last turn of the situation. He had been wandering
blindfold in a maze, and had suddenly found
the centre. Or, rather, he felt as though he had been
moving unsuspectingly over the meshes of a great
spider&#8217;s web, had reached at length the central plexus,
and was there held, uncertain from which point the
fell spinner of the web would dart down to attack him.
Which was the safe way out of this coil of evil? At
least he would not wait paralyzed: he must act.</p>

<p>The chiming of a clock warned him of his engagement
to Gastineau. No; he could not go there again.
The man might not, after all, be an actual murderer,
Martindale might have brought his death on himself.
Still, if anything in this world were sure, it was certain
that Paul Gastineau was a son of evil, as full of cunning
malice as a man could be. How should he meet him
again, how could he touch that guilty hand? Never.
The breach must be made at once, and if a fight was
inevitable, he must declare it.</p>

<p>Herriard drew a case of telegraph forms towards him
and filled one in to Gastineau under his assumed name.
&#8220;Detained in chambers, sorry cannot see you to-night.&#8221;
He went out and sent it off, then turned into a restaurant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
hard by and ate his dinner with what appetite was
left him.</p>

<p>&#8220;He killed Martindale,&#8221; that was the one fact which
kept crying aloud in his brain. He could think of nothing
else. How fate had completed the circle! He tried
to analyze the consequences. Was this knowledge a
weapon in his hand to crush Gastineau? Yes. No.
At least, how could he use it? Would it not mean that
Gastineau with his devilish ingenuity would probably
turn aside the blow that looked so telling, and make a
swift, fierce counter attack to his opponent&#8217;s destruction?
How could he, Herriard, accuse of a terrible
crime the man with whom he had had such a questionable
connection? He was the only man in the world
who knew that Gastineau had survived his injuries.
What an incredible, and, indeed, disreputable, tale he
would have to tell if he ventured to speak out.</p>

<p>Underlying the whole terrible perplexity was a novel
dread of meeting Gastineau. Herriard determined that
he would return to his chambers at once and write a
letter which should break their acquaintance in unmistakable
terms once for all. Fortunately there would
be no need to touch upon this last reason; Gastineau&#8217;s
expressed opinion of Alexia&#8217;s guilt was quite sufficient
to justify her future husband in ceasing to be friendly
with him; indeed it was the course which honour indicated.</p>

<p>So, turning over in his mind the most effective wording
of the letter, Herriard walked back to the Temple.
He would write the letter and post it at once; so it
would be off his mind, and the sooner he could make
Gastineau show his hand the sooner would his suspense
be at an end.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>He went in, lighted a lamp and began the draft of
his letter, the most distasteful he had ever had to write,
but as imperative a task as it was repugnant. He
wrote: &#8220;I have not been able to keep my appointment
with you this evening. I had a long consultation after
the Courts rose, and have been kept in chambers by
other business which I did not foresee. But there is
another reason why I am not coming on to see you
to-night. Our meetings of late have shown me that
we are no longer working harmoniously together as
formerly. Whose the fault it seems scarcely worth considering,
but the fact stands that our differences are
becoming daily more accentuated, and we are, above
all, seriously at issue upon one, to me, most vital point.
I think, then, that it is time our connection came to an
end, as our friendship seems already to have done.
Your restoration to health and active life obviates any
reproach which I might otherwise incur. The time for
separation is apt, and you will understand that I could
not continue to meet on terms of friendship a man
who accuses of a terrible crime the woman who will
shortly be my wife and of whose innocence I am absolutely
convinced. This determination, to which I see
no alternative, in no way contradicts the sense of my
obligations to you. Your advice and help in&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he
stopped. He could hardly be churlish enough to part
from Gastineau without an acknowledgment of all he
owed him. And yet was it wise or safe to put down
that indebtedness in black and white, and give it to
this abnormally unscrupulous man?</p>

<p>Herriard&#8217;s whole legal training and experience told him
it was rash and dangerous, nothing less than the forging
of a very effective weapon to be used against himself.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>Yet if the fact of their partnership was ever to be
brought up against him, he told himself, he would not
deny it, even could he do so successfully. He had done
with him now, he was resolved; and by the truth he
stood ready to atone for what had been false in his
career. Still that was no reason why he need make
his acknowledgments to Gastineau in so explicit a form
that all the world might comprehend exactly what their
connection had been. He drew his pen through the
last words of the draft and began the passage again.</p>

<p>&#8220;To your advice&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>A knock came at the outer door. It startled him
disagreeably, ominously. He laid down his pen, wondering
who this late visitor could be. Opening the door
he found himself face to face with the man on whom
he would have been glad never to set eyes again.</p>

<p>&#8220;You, Gastineau?&#8221; he exclaimed, in a negative tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;I,&#8221; came the almost jeering response. &#8220;I hope I
have not startled you.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Herriard drew back, Gastineau walked past him
into the entrance lobby with the air of a man who could
dispense with an invitation and would take no refusal.
Herriard closed the door, and, indicating the way, followed
him into the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you would not come to see me, Mr. Herriard,&#8221;
Gastineau said, with a sneer, as he turned abruptly,
his keen eyes taking in all that was in the room. &#8220;It
was, however, necessary that I should confer with you
to-night&mdash;you know how I hate procrastination&mdash;so I
have come to see you. I wonder what the business
was that kept you here. The composition of a love-letter?&#8221;</p>

<p>The man&#8217;s contemptuous, malignant tone seemed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
touch the utmost limits of a sneer. His quick glance
had noticed the letter to himself, which lay half written
on the desk.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Herriard answered quietly; &#8220;not a love-letter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s well,&#8221; Gastineau returned, &#8220;for it is about
this love affair of yours that I want to talk to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Holding as we do such different opinions of Countess
Alexia, I would rather the subject were not mentioned
between us,&#8221; Herriard replied. He felt that the crisis
had come, and that it would not do for him to show
weakness. He must face this man, and, after all, with
the knowledge just gained, he was not defenceless.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; objected Gastineau, in his quick, peremptory
way, &#8220;it must be mentioned. You say we are at issue
upon the subject. We are&mdash;more seriously than you
suppose. And for that very reason we must come to
an understanding, and without delay.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had taken his stand opposite Herriard on the
farther side of the writing table, ignoring the chair
which the other had pulled round for him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, then,&#8221; Herriard responded simply.</p>

<p>Gastineau took out a cigarette and lighted it thoughtfully,
with the air of a man considering how best he
should frame what he had to say. Herriard sat and
watched him in expectant silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;The case I have to put to you, my dear Herriard,
is somewhat involved,&#8221; Gastineau began, in a tone
whose lightness rather surprised his listener; &#8220;and I
shall have to touch upon a subject or two which I
would rather avoid. But, you see, when a man performs
the feat of a veritable resurrection such as mine
he is bound to find the line of his life tangled into certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
awkward complications. That is inevitable; you
will grant that?&#8221;</p>

<p>The demand was made in the same easy, buoyant
tone. Herriard nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt it is,&#8221; he answered curtly.</p>

<p>&#8220;So long as I lay in my living grave on that couch,&#8221;
pursued Gastineau, exhaling a long whiff of smoke, &#8220;I
looked upon my past life, my former existence as a
closed book. I anticipated no reason ever to unclasp
it. But I reckoned without our Dr. Hallamar.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Herriard responded, as the other man paused.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; Gastineau continued, always in his tone of
airy argument, &#8220;it being agreed that my coming to
active life again must upset all calculations, the question,
among others, of its interference with our reciprocal
arrangement, our partnership, comes up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Naturally,&#8221; Herriard acquiesced readily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Naturally.&#8221; Gastineau took up the word. &#8220;I wake
to life to find you filling the place which rightly belongs
to me, and which I want, or, at least, might want to
occupy myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Herriard quietly, &#8220;and which in common
justice I should have no wish to keep from you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gastineau took the cigarette from his lips with a deprecating
wave of the hand. &#8220;Don&#8217;t be in a hurry, Mr.
Geoffrey Herriard,&#8221; he said, with a patronizing laugh.
&#8220;I am not at all sure that I want your place, and if I
did, I fancy there is room in the world, legal and political,
for both of us. It is not there, in the House, or
at the Bar, that we are likely to be rivals.&#8221;</p>

<p>Naturally he would not guess how clear the significance
of his last words was to Herriard who sat watching
and wondering what place there could be in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
world for this callous, gibing man-slayer. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see
why we should be rivals at all,&#8221; he observed tentatively.</p>

<p>Gastineau was lighting another cigarette. &#8220;No, my
dear fellow, you don&#8217;t. Because the book I just spoke
of has been kept closed to you. I must open it at a
certain page, and show you why.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gastineau took a step forward and seated himself
on the corner of the writing table. He was half turned
away from Herriard. For a few seconds he smoked
meditatively and there was silence between them. At
length he spoke. &#8220;Once upon a time, before my ill-luck,&#8221;
he laughed,&mdash;&#8220;I refer to the railway accident&mdash;brought
me into connection with Mr. Geoffrey Herriard,
I was in love, deeply in love, with a certain lady whom
I will name in a moment. When I became dead to the
world all idea of that sort of thing was out of the question;
but the <i>status quo</i> has very strangely and unexpectedly
cropped up again. You have followed? Since
our acquaintance, my mantle has fallen upon the said
Mr. Geoffrey Herriard, and on the whole he has worn
it worthily. It is curious that he should moreover have
lighted upon a certain favour which I had proposed to
pin to the said mantle, and had lost. My friend is welcome
to keep the serviceable cloak, but the particular
ornament with which he proposes to adorn it I must
ask him to give up.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused, and a dead, tense silence followed. Gastineau
smoked on nonchalantly, waiting for the other
man to speak.</p>

<p>At length the reply came in a low voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;You ask me to give it up on the assumption that
you have more right to it than I?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>Gastineau nodded. &#8220;Just so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I deny it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gastineau rose to his feet and flung the cigarette-end
into the fire-place. &#8220;I was afraid you might,&#8221; he
said coolly, as he turned and faced Herriard; then added,
&#8220;afraid for your sake, not my own.&#8221;</p>

<p>The preliminaries were over now, and the fight was
to begin in real earnest. Nevertheless Gastineau&#8217;s manner
was as cool and easy as ever. It was like a light
comedian playing, with his characteristic methods, a
strong, dramatic part.</p>

<p>&#8220;I deny,&#8221; Herriard repeated, leaning back and meeting
his look, &#8220;I deny that the prior claim you allege
is valid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Allege?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Allege. Were you ever engaged to the Countess
Alexia von Rohnburg?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Practically, yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I take upon myself to deny that also.&#8221; How he
had come to loathe this man whose manifest character
fitted in every moment more closely with his recently
gained knowledge of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You do?&#8221; Gastineau laughed, but it was an ugly
laugh now. &#8220;On what grounds, pray?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; Herriard answered, &#8220;the Countess Alexia
would support my denial. Anyhow, I am content to
maintain my position on the assumption that she was
never engaged to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if you find you are wrong?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To retire in your favour, at the Countess&#8217;s bidding.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; Gastineau returned, in a set tone of determination,
&#8220;we need not wait for that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Herriard thought of Alexia, then of the man before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
him, and his obvious intention to renew the old persecution.
He rose and faced him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not understand you, Gastineau,&#8221; he said steadily.
&#8220;You say you believe Countess Alexia guilty of
Martindale&#8217;s death, yet it seems you want to marry
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gastineau gave an ugly laugh, the scoffing, derisive
note of intellectual evil. &#8220;Why not, my good Herriard?
<i>L&#8217;un n&#8217;emp&egrave;che pas l&#8217;autre.</i> The devil in a
woman has an irresistible attraction for some men;
men of a certain enterprise and courage. You remember
the notorious Raymond case? I forget the average
number of offers of marriage Mrs. Raymond received
every day during the inquest and trial. The Countess
is much more suited to be my wife than yours. Anyhow,
I mean to claim her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Herriard flushed with indignation. Alexia the wife
of this cold-blooded schemer, this incarnation of militant
spite? The idea was hideous, unbearable.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Countess Alexia is engaged to me,&#8221; he said with
restraint. &#8220;I do not mean to give her up to you or
any man.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gastineau just let his eyes rest on Herriard&#8217;s face
for an instant. Then, laughing, he turned and lighted
another cigarette. &#8220;I am sorry to hear it for your own
sake, my dear Geoffrey,&#8221; he replied, with the dangerous
suavity of the feline&#8217;s velvet paw. &#8220;You mean to
fight?&#8221;</p>

<p>Herriard laughed now, bitterly enough.</p>

<p>&#8220;You surely can scarcely expect me to give up the
Countess at your cool request.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gastineau shrugged. &#8220;Perhaps not,&#8221; he returned
slowly. &#8220;It may need more than a request. In the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
meantime&mdash;you are an ungrateful dog, Geoffrey Herriard.
It only shows even I can be a fool sometimes;
I actually thought I might expect gratitude from you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am grateful, very grateful to you,&#8221; Herriard returned
sturdily. &#8220;I am fully sensible of all you have
done for me and of the debt I owe you. But when you
talk of my giving up to you the woman who is going
to be my wife you are asking more than is reasonable,
you are asking me to pay you by robbing another.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed?&#8221; Gastineau, still in his mood of devilish
coolness, raised his brows in a sneer. &#8220;I did not think
it was as bad as that. What a change the point of
view makes. Now my idea is that I am simply asking
you, in return for the benefits you have received from
me, not to make a fuss about returning some lost property
of mine which you have accidentally found.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must deny that,&#8221; Herriard returned, with set
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Deny what?&#8221; was the bland inquiry.</p>

<p>&#8220;That the property, that the Countess Alexia, ever
was yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gastineau&#8217;s face assumed a look of tolerant protest.
It was as though he were considering what argument
he could use with a man whose reasoning was so
dense and trivial. So for a few moments he smoked in
silence. Then he asked, &#8220;She has told you so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Practically.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; Gastineau affected to see his way clear once
more. &#8220;The Countess has mentioned my name to
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>The other nodded receptively. &#8220;What, may I ask,
has she told you?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>The question was pertinent enough; more critical
than Gastineau let his manner indicate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Merely,&#8221; Herriard answered, &#8220;that you made love
to her, and that she did not return the feeling. That
should explain my refusal to yield my claim to yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It might,&#8221; Gastineau sneered, &#8220;to a shallow mind.&#8221;
Manifestly, he was pricked disagreeably by Herriard&#8217;s
pointed answer; his coolness was now maintained by
an effort. &#8220;You might,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;by this have
known me better than to suppose that I should allow
myself to be defrauded of what I choose to set my
heart upon. But we shall see. So the Countess told
you she did not reciprocate my feeling. That was a
somewhat gratuitous and easy statement to make about
a dead man. Don&#8217;t you think so. By the way,&#8221; he
gave Herriard no time to answer the question, fixing
his piercing eyes upon him with the look that seemed
to penetrate all prevarication, all evasion, to scorch up
the mere fencing of the tongue, &#8220;I presume the Countess
has no idea that I am alive?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None,&#8221; came the ready answer. &#8220;She certainly
believes you to be dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>Obviously frank though the reply was, Gastineau
demanded again, &#8220;You have not told her that I am
alive?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or even half alive?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no. I should be sorry to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you?&#8221; he snapped suspiciously. &#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>The question was an awkward one, seeing that Herriard
had no desire to irritate Gastineau unnecessarily.
He gave a shrug. &#8220;It might cause her the embarrassment
of an unpleasant <i>arri&egrave;re pens&eacute;e</i>.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>&#8220;Why embarrassment? Why unpleasant?&#8221; The
sharp questions came with the insistence not merely
of a keen cross-examiner, but of a jealous man.</p>

<p>&#8220;The thought that she could never return your affection,&#8221;
Herriard answered, as plausibly as he could.</p>

<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; Gastineau returned, with quiet incisiveness,
&#8220;is a matter you may leave to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The cool superiority of his tone stung Herriard, giving
him the necessary spur to stand up to his dangerous
adversary. &#8220;Understand, Gastineau,&#8221; he retorted,
&#8220;that I decline to leave it to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As Countess Alexia&#8217;s affianced husband, I do&mdash;naturally.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Naturally!&#8221; Gastineau repeated the word with
an infinity of mocking scorn. &#8220;You would. It was
only to be expected. And, as the expected, I am prepared
to meet it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; Herriard replied. &#8220;We now know how
we stand. I am, at least, glad you pay me the compliment
of anticipating that I should not be ready to
give up the Countess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is scarcely a compliment from my point of view,&#8221;
Gastineau rejoined, with a vicious drawing back of the
lips into the semblance of a smile. &#8220;If you were not
a fool, Geoffrey Herriard, you would know better than
to oppose yourself to a man who lets nothing thwart
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We may be equally determined in this affair,&#8221; Herriard
returned with restraint; &#8220;you to persecute the
Countess, I to protect her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Persecute?&#8221; Gastineau cried, with a short, high-pitched
laugh. &#8220;Persecute is a strong word, Herriard.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>&#8220;Yet, I fancy, the correct one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where did you learn it? From the Countess?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gastineau drew in his breath sharply through his
clenched teeth. &#8220;Very well. And so we are going to
fight. My last piece of advice to my apt pupil,&#8221; he
sneered, &#8220;might be to consider the consequences of joining
issue with a man who, he knows, never submits to
defeat, who, he might imagine, will let nothing stand
in his way, even a life, when once his resolve is taken.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I quite understand that; it needs no effort of the
imagination,&#8221; Herriard retorted, as for a moment his
temper and his repugnance for the man who, with such
glib assurance, stood threatening him, got the better
of his restraint.</p>

<p>The slight hit told. The only question was whether
it had not been a chance one from a bow drawn at a
venture. Into Gastineau&#8217;s eyes there sprang that fierce
look of piercing enquiry which was characteristic of the
man&#8217;s avid mind. &#8220;You know that,&#8221; he snarled, the
effort at sneering coolness ousted by the obtrusion of
a dark suspicion. &#8220;You know that,&#8221; he repeated insolently,
&#8220;do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>But the other man was now on his guard. &#8220;Evidently,
by your own showing, I ought to believe you
capable of anything,&#8221; he answered, with almost a sneer
bred of his consciousness of power in reserve.</p>

<p>&#8220;You meant more than that,&#8221; Gastineau insisted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Could I mean more than that?&#8221; came the obvious
retort.</p>

<p>Gastineau for a moment was silent. Only his fierce
eyes seemed to scorch into Herriard&#8217;s mind, to read
the working of his secret soul.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>Then with a snatch he took up his hat. &#8220;Enough
of this,&#8221; he exclaimed with vicious impatience. &#8220;I am
never sorry when words fail and we come to action.
I have your answer, Herriard? You will not break off
this engagement and make way for me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Decidedly not. The question is hardly worth answering.&#8221;</p>

<p>The words, considering to whom spoken, were bold,
but Gastineau seemed scarcely to hear them. On his
way towards the door he had moved round to the side
of the writing table. His eyes were fixed upon a card
which lay on it, a card which announced the visit of
Detective Inspector Quickjohn. Herriard had gone
towards the door to open it, and now turned to see
why his visitor lingered. Gastineau&#8217;s glance had shifted
from Quickjohn&#8217;s card to the unfinished letter to himself
which still lay open on the desk. In an instant
he had grasped the fact that he had surprised Herriard
in the act of writing to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;A letter to me,&#8221; he exclaimed, as with a swift movement
he caught up the paper. &#8220;I may read it, and so
save trouble, or, at least, delay.&#8221; As he spoke his eyes
were rapidly running down the page. The purport of
the letter was already his when Herriard put forth a
protesting hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is of no importance now,&#8221; he said hastily. &#8220;Your
visit has rendered it needless for me to write.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Gastineau kept the paper from the other&#8217;s hand.
His face as he read grew dark and sneering, and a sneer
was but that cynic&#8217;s handy mask. &#8220;It is written to
me, intended for me,&#8221; he maintained, turning to evade
Herriard&#8217;s effort to snatch the letter. &#8220;I have surely
a right to read it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>&#8220;You have none,&#8221; Herriard objected.</p>

<p>The sharp eyes had got the pith of the letter, and
Gastineau threw it on the table. &#8220;So!&#8221; He seemed
to reflect for a few moments, to be making a swift
resolve. Herriard, intending to let him out, had left
the door ajar. Gastineau moved suddenly forward,
and, instead of, as the other expected, passing out, he
quickly shut the door and locked it.</p>

<small>THE STRUGGLE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was all done in one swift action; the outcome
of a planned determination. As Gastineau turned,
Herriard saw that the scoffing contemptuous coolness
had gone: his expression now was more that of a feline
animal on the spring. The thought uppermost in his
mind now was, &#8220;Is it possible that I ever called this
man my friend?&#8221; He saw a crisis had come; how his
letter should have hastened and accentuated it he could
not comprehend. But that was due to the slower power
of perception in his own mind compared with his adversary&#8217;s.</p>

<p>There was a curiously set look of relentless purpose
in Gastineau&#8217;s eyes as he turned; one which, among all
the varying expressions he had noticed, Herriard had
never seen there before. It was the look with which a
Prelate of the Inquisition might have watched a victim
in the torture chamber.</p>

<p>&#8220;A reckoning between us, Mr. Herriard, seems more
pressing than I had supposed.&#8221; He spoke with tight
lips just opening enough to clip out the words. Herriard
said nothing; only stood watchfully expectant
with, now, a thought of Martindale&#8217;s fate suggesting
itself. So he waited for the other to declare the intention
that was manifestly in his mind.</p>

<p>Gastineau stood with his hands behind him; pale,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
thin almost to frailness, but the very embodiment of
mental boldness; the courage of the head, that can unhesitatingly
attack greater strength of body.</p>

<p>&#8220;So,&#8221; he said slowly, &#8220;the business that kept you
away from Devereux Street to-night was the writing
of a letter to say you could not come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hardly that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps your visitor detained you,&#8221; Gastineau continued,
in a key which was the prelude of mischief,
the muttering of a coming storm. &#8220;Your visitor,&#8221; he
pointed to the card, &#8220;Detective&mdash;what&#8217;s his name?&mdash;Quickjohn.
I do not quite understand you, Mr. Herriard.
May I ask what Inspector Quickjohn came to
see you about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About the Vaux House business,&#8221; Herriard answered
curtly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! Why does he come to see you about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir Henry Ferrars sent him. He knows I am interested
in the case.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what had he to tell you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon me, Gastineau; I think we agreed that the
subject should not be discussed between us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; he replied insistently. &#8220;But my interest
is now at least equal to yours, through the same
source, the Countess Alexia. What did Quickjohn come
to tell you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Evasion was difficult under the searchlight of those
transfixing eyes, but the whole truth could not be
told. &#8220;He came to say,&#8221; Herriard answered, &#8220;that he
is following the matter up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With what result?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No definite result at present.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He took the trouble to come and tell you that?&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
Gastineau was holding him to the point with a greater
than professional tenacity.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had told them at Scotland Yard that they seemed
inclined to let the case drop.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gastineau paused, but his was the silence of disbelief.
He took a few sharp, impatient steps to his former
position. Then spoke abruptly, his viciousness smouldering
and ever ready to burst into flame. &#8220;Shall I tell
you what I think of you, Geoffrey Herriard?&#8221;</p>

<p>Herriard shrugged. &#8220;I do not care.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What,&#8221; Gastineau went on, ignoring the reply,
&#8220;I think of you by the light of your recent conduct
towards me, the man who made you, the man who can,
and will, unmake you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have nothing to reproach myself with,&#8221; Herriard
said, beginning to tire of the scene.</p>

<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; retorted Gastineau, &#8220;shows you in a more
contemptible light still.&#8221; The fire was glowing now,
any instant might bring the flame. &#8220;You think yourself
a clever fellow, Herriard, but your really clever
man discriminates. He does not play tricks upon men
cleverer than himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not aware that I have tried to play a trick
on you, Gastineau.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No? What do you call the withholding your knowledge
of the one man in Europe who could cure me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not. I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Gastineau stopped him with a sharp, impatient gesture.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t trouble to deny it. You met and knew
Hallamar weeks, months, before it suited you to mention
him to me. Oh, don&#8217;t protest: I have neither
time nor inclination to listen to your lies. I don&#8217;t
blame you. I might have done the same in your place.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
My being a helpless cripple, a man with both feet literally
in the grave, a brain without a body, meant
everything to you. You played your game, taking the
risk, and lost it; lost it through a miscalculation of our
respective smartness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are wrong, Gastineau, utterly,&#8221; Herriard broke
in with indignation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I?&#8221; he returned, with a sneer. &#8220;I know you,
Geoffrey Herriard, better, possibly, than you know yourself.
You have been playing a dangerous game; are
playing it still; but you have made more than one false
move, and the game is lost. There only remains for
you to pay.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stopped; shutting his lips with the suggestion that
he had no more to say. The pause of that dark, evil
mind, between speech and action, was like the crouching
of a tiger for its spring; like the breathless hold-up
which precedes the first flash of a storm. Gastineau
stood facing Herriard with a world of concentrated malignity
blazing in his eyes, the tokens of the fiery soul
behind them. Herriard waited, nervously alert. He saw
the futility of protesting against the charges; this man
was his enemy, whose cue and desire it was to quarrel;
a struggle, terrible, perhaps to the death, was inevitable.</p>

<p>For some moments the two men watched each other,
the one seeming to cast about for an opening for attack,
the other apprehensively strung for defence. Surely
that keen, active brain would not need to wait long.
No. Gastineau&#8217;s lips parted, showing the white teeth,
still set as he spoke through them, spoke as with a
purpose of making an end quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You were writing that letter to me&#8221;&mdash;he pointed
to it&mdash;&#8220;after your interview with Quickjohn. Why?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>&#8220;I had no time to write before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you were coming&mdash;don&#8217;t fence, it is waste of
time&mdash;you were coming to my house this evening, or
you would have telegraphed earlier.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Herriard replied watchfully. &#8220;I had my
doubts as to whether it would serve any good purpose,
and meant to have written before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you would understand,&#8221; Gastineau said cuttingly,
&#8220;that there is nothing gained by lying to me.
Accepting your statement for what it may be worth,
Quickjohn told you something that clenched your decision?&#8221;</p>

<p>Each man&#8217;s eyes were fixed on the other&#8217;s; Herriard&#8217;s
held to Gastineau&#8217;s by the fascination of the evil and
danger they signalled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he? did he?&#8221; The question came hissed out
with sharp insistence. For Herriard, posed by the direct
challenge, hesitated, at a loss for the moment as
to the course he should take.</p>

<p>&#8220;You believe nothing I say; I will say nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pouf!&#8221; It was a poor evasion, and the strong man
blew it aside with a contemptuous exclamation. &#8220;Just
realize the position, Herriard,&#8221; he said; &#8220;the position
in which you stand. I am a dead man; a man with
no known or legally recognized existence. As such, I
am all-powerful, and, with my brains, intangible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So long,&#8221; Herriard found courage to retort, &#8220;as I
do not proclaim your existence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Precisely.&#8221; The look on Gastineau&#8217;s face, as he
nodded a ready acquiescence, told Herriard he had
spoken rashly. &#8220;So long. And the longer the better
for me. In short, it would be to my interest that your
silence should last till the Day of Judgment.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>&#8220;I have no intention of breaking it,&#8221; Herriard said,
as coolly as his nerves allowed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I might doubt that,&#8221; Gastineau returned, &#8220;when
I find you and the celebrated Inspector Quickjohn
putting your heads together. They say two heads are
better than one, but that depends upon the heads. I
think I will back mine against yours and Quickjohn&#8217;s.
Now, if you hope to leave this room alive, which is
entirely my affair, just say what that fellow told you
about me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at his watch, and coolly replaced it. Herriard
found himself asking whether, after all, he was
not being made the victim of a transcendent piece of
bluff. Gastineau&#8217;s acuteness and penetration were manifest
enough; but his power? Had not he himself the
whip hand, if only he would not let it be paralyzed by
the stronger brain? His enemy was but a head-fighter,
a tongue duellist; there was a clever suggestion of something
more; but if it came to that, to physical force,
the advantage would be the other way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quickjohn knows nothing about you,&#8221; he said
shortly, throwing off the vague fear that had possessed
him. &#8220;He is as ignorant as the rest of the world that
you are alive. Now, may I ask you to go? I have
had enough of these recriminations, and do not mean
to allow myself to be terrorized over by you. Threatening
is a game that two can play at, and the odds are
scarcely on your side.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took a step towards the door; then remembered
that it was locked.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a recoiling threat on your part.&#8221;</p>

<p>Herriard heard the significant rejoinder, but paid
no heed to it. He was sick of the scene, and the evil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
presence in his room was repugnant to him. &#8220;Give
me the key,&#8221; he demanded, turning.</p>

<p>Gastineau&#8217;s right hand was in his coat pocket. As
he took a swift step forward, he withdrew it, his eyes
fixed with a peculiar mesmeric gaze upon Herriard&#8217;s.
Something in the look warned Herriard; it was not
that of one who is simply giving up a key on demand.
But the one man&#8217;s eyes seemed to hold the other&#8217;s;
only, they drove him, instinctively, to take a step backwards.
It was well. For as Herriard put out his hand,
Gastineau struck at him, at his heart, and the backward
movement caused the blow to fall short by perhaps
half an inch. Next instant Herriard with a cry
of indignation seized the striking arm and closed with
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, murderer!&#8221;</p>

<p>Herriard felt a sharp prick at his breast and struggled
desperately to keep the deadly hand away. He
could not have believed that Gastineau was so strong:
his arms, wrists, fingers were like joints of steel; while
the spirit that governed their movement, their efforts,
with deadly purpose, seemed ten times stronger than
his own incentive to self-preservation.</p>

<p>It was that fierce vigour of mind that made the
struggle equal; the body that for years had lain half
dead a match now for a younger man who had never
known ill-health. And to Herriard the wrestle was
complicated by reason of the sharp weapon that each
man was trying to force in an opposite direction; all
Gastineau&#8217;s vicious energy was concentrated towards
getting his right hand free to strike. It was a strange
encounter, carried on, fierce as it was, almost without
noise: indeed there was none, save the heavy breathing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
of the two adversaries. By sheer weight Gastineau had
been forced to the wall, against which he was held
struggling quietly with a planned reason for every
movement he made. With him was no waste of energy;
only against Herriard&#8217;s greater strength he could
not work his will. But on Herriard&#8217;s part the struggle,
fierce in its terrible intensity, was but a mechanical
effort at self-defence. What was to be the end of it?
What did it, must it, portend? If, that was, he got the
better of his enemy; if it went the other way, the end
was certain enough. In a few minutes he would be a
dead man, and no soul on earth the wiser as to whence
his death-blow had come. There were but the muscles
of his arm between him and extinction. The thought
nerved him; he tightened his grip on Gastineau, casting
about for an effectual means of wresting from him
the weapon, a long, tapering stiletto, used for piercing
documents, which had lain on the writing table. It
seemed as though, if he tried, he could turn it and drive
it into the evil heart, to the world&#8217;s advantage. If it
came to that&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Suddenly Gastineau seemed to collapse, the tension
of his muscles relaxed, his legs gave way, Herriard was
supporting rather than restraining him now. There
was a strange, fixed, unfathomable expression in Gastineau&#8217;s
eyes as he hung forwards, helplessly, it seemed:
only held up by Herriard&#8217;s grip. He could have sent
him out of the world then; and just because he realized
how easy it would be, he put away the intention. Indeed,
as Gastineau&#8217;s limp weight lurched forward against
him, his head hanging down, Herriard asked himself
whether nature were not about to take a desirable, if
unpleasant, task, out of human hands.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>So he let Gastineau slip to the floor, and, as he lay,
tried once more to take the deadly point from him.
But the grasp of the fingers round it was as rigid as
that of a dead hand. Still holding the wrist, Herriard
paused in perplexity. What was he to do? how was
this affair to end?</p>

<p>&#8220;Gastineau,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;let go; give up this
thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>The words were futile; the white face on the floor
gave no sign that they were heard; the fist remained
clenched tightly as ever round the weapon&#8217;s handle.
Gastineau was breathing heavily, peculiarly, at considerable
intervals, sighing rather than simply breathing:
his eyes, half-closed, seemed to see nothing. In a tense,
horrible silence, broken only by an occasional deep
breath from Gastineau, the moments passed without
bringing relief to Herriard&#8217;s situation, or suggesting an
end to the affair, save one. Was the man dying? It
seemed almost like it. His breathing, to Herriard&#8217;s untrained
ear, seemed stertorous; and now and again
there came a catch and a rattle in the throat. The
man was dying. His patched-up strength had evidently
given way under the strain: the mind had urged on the
body beyond its half-recovered powers, and the result
was the collapse before him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gastineau!&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment Herriard forgot his enemy&#8217;s diabolical
nature in the feeling of almost awe-struck sorrow for
the man who had led him to success. That the end of
it all should have come thus swiftly and awfully filled
him with a vague terror.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gastineau!&#8221;</p>

<p>The body before him quivered; he thought the thin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
lips, almost set, murmured something. Changing his
position, he bent over, and set himself to raise the fallen
head. As he did so, a rigor seemed to seize and shake
Gastineau; he groaned feebly and caught his breath: it
seemed as though the end was near. Near? Herriard,
relaxing something of his grasp, bent down to hear what
the lips seemed to murmur. Then he found an arm
holding his neck like in a vice, his head was pulled down,
the wrist which he gripped was jerked free, and, with a
convulsive, concentrated muscular effort, Gastineau
raised himself and held him down. The relative positions
of the two men had in a moment become reversed,
and Herriard was looking up into the face set over him
full of the triumph of a diabolical cunning.</p>

<p>&#8220;My good Herriard,&#8221; said the scoffing voice through
the curl of those hateful lips, &#8220;you are hopelessly stupid.
What did you think? That you could snuff out Paul
Gastineau by holding him against the wall?&#8221; He
laughed. Herriard saw the glint of the steel raised to
strike. He had no breath to struggle; the tense, cruel
fingers gripped his throat mercilessly, the weight of Gastineau&#8217;s
body was on his chest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gastineau, for God&#8217;s sake&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he gasped, and all
the reply was a laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you know I did for Martindale,&#8221; he heard the
words through the buzzing of the compressed blood
in his ears. &#8220;Dangerous knowledge. Too dangerous
to live.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gastineau moved slightly backward to strike. Herriard
gave a stifled cry in the agony of death. Then
through the rooms there sounded the startling noise of
a sharp knocking at the outer door.</p>

<p>With every sense strung to its acutest point, Herriard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
heard it and made a desperate effort to call out;
but the hand on his throat tightened, and the cry was
abortive. Then, for a few seconds, dead silence followed.
Gastineau was thinking, planning with that
swift brain of his; determining which course to take
of the urgent choice before him. Life and death were
in the wavering balance, and Herriard lay watching
the cruel face as the indicator of which side the scale
of his existence dropped. Then came another knocking,
and Herriard with a tremendous effort partially
freed himself and sent forth a great half-strangled cry.
Next instant he was released, for Gastineau had sprung
to his feet, and stood for the moment irresolute. Herriard
rose now, and shouted; what he knew not. But
the shout seemed to determine Gastineau. He took
the key from his pocket, unlocked the door and went
out. Herriard, steadying himself, followed warily into
the lobby. Gastineau was not to be seen. The outer
door stood ajar. It opened wider now to admit a man&#8217;s
form. Herriard sprang forward with a cry, and, to
his inexpressible relief, found himself confronted by
Count Prosper von Rohnburg.</p>

<small>THE WAYS OF MAYFAIR</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;THEY say,&#8221; announced Dormer Greetland, with
the seriousness befitting an important pronouncement,
&#8220;that Countess Alexia is going to marry Herriard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One is scarcely surprised to hear it,&#8221; Lady Rotherfield
commented in a non-committal tone. Having
once got down on the wrong side of the fence, she had
climbed up again to her perch, and was disposed to sit
there and argue that her rash descent had not been
altogether unwise. &#8220;But is it true?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite proper,&#8221; laughed the shrill voice of Baron de
Daun, &#8220;that Perseus should marry Andromeda. It is
true? Of course it is the natural thing for people to
say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have it on the best authority,&#8221; was the Mayfair
newsman&#8217;s somewhat vague reply. &#8220;Naturally it was
the first thing we should be told. But one would hardly
accept the banal chatter of irresponsible outsiders. No,
dear lady, you will find it authentic now. I might have
told you the news a fortnight ago, but then it was
merely in the air. To-day&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He gave a shrug as
though they would discredit his imprimatur at their peril.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I should say there is something in it,&#8221; Sir
Perrott Aspall declared. &#8220;I was talking to Dick Josselyn
at the Club just now, and he tells me that Herriard
is returning all his briefs.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>&#8220;Really?&#8221; exclaimed Lady Rotherfield, trying to
gauge the significance of the last piece of news.</p>

<p>&#8220;That looks as though something were in the wind,&#8221;
de Daun suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; put in Greetland. &#8220;Herriard wouldn&#8217;t accept
a brief for poor Lady Ranower. She had set her
heart upon retaining him for her appeal.&#8221; This was
pure invention; but its author could not have it supposed
that Sir Perrott&#8217;s announcement was news to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose it will be a quiet affair?&#8221; Lady Rotherfield
was alluding to Alexia&#8217;s marriage, not to Lady
Ranower&#8217;s appeal.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should hope so,&#8221; Greetland replied charitably.
&#8220;Between ourselves, one can scarcely call the Countess
quite re-established.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, well,&#8221; observed Lady Rotherfield, still hedging,
&#8220;a very suitable match. Mr. Herriard is quite a somebody.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; said de Daun, who had taken recent opportunities
of cultivating Herriard on the strength of
his coming position in the world. &#8220;But why should he
return his briefs, eh? Is that the fashion here when one
is to be married?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hardly,&#8221; laughed Sir Perrott. &#8220;Unless one is in a
great hurry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, that is it, you may depend,&#8221; said Greetland.
&#8220;It is coming off at once. By to-night I shall know
all about it. A long honeymoon to wear out an attenuating
scandal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish,&#8221; said Lady Rotherfield presently to Greetland
in a confidential corner, &#8220;one knew exactly what
to do about poor Countess Alexia. It is so very awkward.
What line are people taking? Do advise me.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>&#8220;Lady Kilvinton calls,&#8221; the smart authority declared,
somewhat with the air of a dogmatic stockbroker advising
a client as to her investments. &#8220;And yesterday
when I was in Green Street I saw two carriages outside
the house. I was on the other side, but I think&mdash;I&#8217;m
pretty sure&mdash;the Ramplingham crest was on one of
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m!&#8221; Lady Rotherfield pursed her lips meditatively.
&#8220;You don&#8217;t go there yourself?&#8221; she asked
shrewdly.</p>

<p>He shrugged. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t had a moment to go anywhere,
except where I have been booked; and then,
as it is, have been able to keep only half my engagements,&#8221;
he replied, with weary plausibility. &#8220;You
know, dear lady, what a rush there always is towards
the end of the season. Oh, no; I don&#8217;t mean to drop
the von Rohnburgs. Count Prosper is a very decent
fellow; and I always liked Lady Alexia. She is so interesting,
and her breeding is perfect, which is more than
one can say for all foreigners. That appalling Lady
Beeman, for instance, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Goldknecht, who, I should
say, came out of the Judengasse originally. No; when
one comes back from Homburg and the country-house
round, which, by the way, promises to be severely trying
this autumn, I shall certainly give our friends in Green
Street a call. They will hardly expect a busy man to
do more this side of November than leave a card.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you think,&#8221; Lady Rotherfield said, with a
certain clearing of doubt, &#8220;that one may venture to
take them up again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see no risk now, dear lady, or I would not let
you do it,&#8221; the cotillon-expert assured her, this time
with the air of a doctor pronouncing a patient at last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
free from infection. &#8220;You see, Herriard is bound to
come on; he is quite pointed out and listened to in the
House; and the Countess is bound to have a large <i>dot</i>.
Yes; they will have to be reckoned with when they
have settled down, and the nine days&#8217; wonder is conveniently
forgotten. With her style and <i>nous</i> theirs is
quite likely to be one of the smart houses to go to, and
if he got to the front Bench her receptions might attain
the dignity of a <i>salon</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Rotherfield was beginning to wonder whether
she had not sat too long on the fence. &#8220;You really
think that?&#8221; she murmured uncomfortably. Then
went on almost beseechingly, &#8220;Mr. Greetland, you know
one hates to do the wrong thing. Do you think it
would look odd if one sent these dear people a card
for next Tuesday? You know I am having some music;
Marzoni has promised to sing, and I am trying to get
Tarbosch; only these tiresome musical people give themselves
such provoking airs. Is it too late?&#8221;</p>

<p>Greetland appeared to reflect. &#8220;H&#8217;m! How long
have the cards been out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nearly a month,&#8221; the lady answered, with a little
rueful grimace. &#8220;One has to make refusals as difficult
as possible in these days of competition.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just so,&#8221; Greetland assented. &#8220;Poor Mrs. Pelham
Steinthal never sends her cards out less than six weeks
ahead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Naturally. A deplorable woman like that. I&#8217;m
afraid even that precaution does not prevent the refusals.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. But if she gets one acceptance in eight she considers
she has done extremely well. And the poor woman
is really improving. I have edited her list for her.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>&#8220;A pleasant task! But you are always so sweet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a labour of Hercules; especially as one had
never heard of quite two-thirds of the people; and when
I enquired who in the world they were, the tiresome
woman would hold a brief for the distressing unknowns.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She might have concluded,&#8221; observed Lady Rotherfield
graciously, &#8220;that any one unknown to Mr. Dormer
Greetland was not worth knowing.&#8221;</p>

<p>The arbiter of social pretension accepted the compliment
as no more than his due. &#8220;Well, I had at
last to act on that assumption,&#8221; he said acquiescently.
&#8220;Arguing the value of various unknown quantities became
fatiguing. It took me quite half-an-hour&#8217;s hard
lecturing to make the absurd woman understand that
a merely rich hostess, to be a success, must never receive
any but her social superiors. Equals and inferiors
in such a case give away the show at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes,&#8221; Lady Rotherfield agreed, with a half sigh;
&#8220;people of that sort cannot be too careful. Unfortunately
they will not realize the fact that it is as much
as we can do to tolerate them singly; in battalions they
are utterly overpowering. Now, Mr. Greetland, about
the poor Countess Alexia. Do you think one might
venture?&#8221;</p>

<p>With a slightly obvious effort Greetland brought his
mind back to the subject from which it had strayed.
&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said judicially, &#8220;I think you might. You
must chance their not having heard of your reception,
with other things to occupy their minds. You might
scribble an excuse for short notice; say you have had
unheard-of difficulties with your fiddler.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, thank you so much, dear Mr. Greetland; it is
truly sweet of you. I&#8217;ll do that at once. Yes; these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
wretched fiddlers and their exasperating ways have
their uses sometimes. I hope you are coming, Mr.
Greetland?&#8221;</p>

<p>A cloud crossed the face which was to so many hostesses
the social sun. &#8220;I am engaged a hundred deep
for Tuesday,&#8221; he smiled protestingly, &#8220;but I&#8217;ll do my
best. You might let me know, dear lady, if Tarbosch
is really coming to play for you. I just missed him
at Lady Llanthony&#8217;s the other night, and one must be
able to say one has heard him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll make the wretch decide, and then send you a
wire,&#8221; she promised.</p>

<p>Greetland rose. He had given Lady Rotherfield more
of the light of his complacent countenance than was
quite her due, and should be moving round in his orbit
to illuminate and attract the rest of the world. A man
passed him with a nod and a casual remark. Greetland
turned back to Lady Rotherfield.</p>

<p>&#8220;Talking of our friends in Green Street,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;that man has been having an uncomfortable time over
the Vaux House affair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He? Who?&#8221; the lady asked, putting up her
glasses.</p>

<p>Greetland looked up at her with a suspicion of pitying
contempt. Really she was, considering her position,
very stupid and ill-informed. He had indeed been wasting
his time with her, and made a mental note that he
would try and hear Tarbosch somewhere else than under
her irritating auspices.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know?&#8221; he asked, almost tartly. &#8220;Aubrey
Playford. It is an open secret that he denounced
the Countess Alexia to the <i>Daily Comet</i>. Had recognized
the dagger hair-pin as being hers, and so got them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
into all this trouble. They say he and Brailsford nearly
came to blows in the Park last Sunday over the affair.
Of course Brailsford is trying to whitewash himself with
the mob, and particularly to get back into certain houses
where he is no longer asked. They say old Lord Clovelly
threatened to kick him into Piccadilly if he showed
his face at Bude House again. So he thought the best
move would be to horsewhip Playford, just to show his
<i>bona fides</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How amusing!&#8221; Lady Rotherfield made a mental
tick against that enterprising editor&#8217;s name. &#8220;But,
tell me, why did Mr. Playford accuse the poor Countess
Alexia?&#8221;</p>

<p>Greetland smiled significantly. &#8220;Surely you can
guess the reason, dear lady,&#8221; he replied, with a trace
of impatience. &#8220;No need to <i>chercher la femme</i> when
she is already there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, just so. A case of pique. But what bad form.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So every one thinks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe I have asked him for Tuesday. How
awkward! Still, he is here. I always thought Lady
Polloxfen so particular.&#8221;</p>

<p>Greetland gave a smile of superior insight. &#8220;So she
is, dear lady; but you must remember that Aubrey
Playford is heir presumptive to his cousin&#8217;s title, and
the Stainford property is practically bound to go with
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To be sure!&#8221; Lady Rotherfield&#8217;s brow cleared once
more. And presently when, by accident or design, she
encountered that eligible sneak, she begged him with
her sweetest smile not to forget he was engaged to her
for Tuesday when that delightful Tarbosch was positively
going to play.</p>

<small>HERRIARD&#8217;S CONFESSION</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE gossips for once were right about Herriard and
Countess Alexia. They were going to be married
almost immediately, and with a view to that event
Herriard was preparing to interrupt his work at the
Bar. Whither his position was drifting him he knew
not: the developments directed by the inscrutable brain
of a Gastineau were not to be forecasted. But, at least,
if his career was checked, he would now be pecuniarily
independent of briefs.</p>

<p>When, on the night of his terrible danger, he found
with a great thrill of relief that his opportune visitor
was Count Prosper, he invited him, in a half-dazed
fashion, into his room, making what excuse of illness
he could to account for his perturbed and disordered
appearance. His explanations were suspiciously incoherent,
for his mind was preoccupied with the problem
as to what prompt action, if any, he ought to take
with regard to Gastineau. But his visitor was an easy-going
fellow; not given, at any rate outside his profession,
to probing for recondite motives; and although
he regarded Herriard&#8217;s confusion and disarray with a
certain amount of wondering curiosity, he yet accepted
the sight as a mere abnormality with which he did not
happen to be familiar.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wondered what was the matter,&#8221; he laughed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
&#8220;when I found you had opened the door and then
disappeared.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Gastineau had not passed out. He was still in
the chambers. Herriard could not, for his life, determine
what he had best do.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had to go into the City to our Consulate,&#8221; Count
Prosper proceeded chattily. &#8220;I was kept there late over
some troublesome business, and one of the men took
me to dine at some famous old eating-house. Strolling
homewards, I passed the Temple and thought to see
if you were to be still found in your den.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad you did,&#8221; was Herriard&#8217;s fervent response.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you hard at work?&#8221; the Count went on. &#8220;No.
You cannot work with a bad headache. Let us take
a hansom home and blow it away. Alexia is alone, and
dull enough, I expect. Come!&#8221;</p>

<p>He rose with a smile, and laid his hand affectionately
on the other&#8217;s shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Herriard, feeling that, though unseasonable,
it was the only thing possible. &#8220;I shall be
glad, if you will wait till I make myself tidy.&#8221;</p>

<p>He went out warily into the lobby. The outer door
was ajar. He tried to recollect. &#8220;Prosper,&#8221; he said,
returning to the room, &#8220;do you remember whether I
shut the outside door when you came in?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, my dear fellow,&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;I performed
that office myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are sure?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite positive.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Gastineau was gone. The open door showed that.
Yet it was with an apprehensive watchfulness that Herriard
entered the little dressing-room where his enemy
must have waited. He was not there now. He had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
disappeared; gone out upon the world an impersonal
force for evil, a living man with, for the time, no legal
existence.</p>

<p>The relief from the close, baleful atmosphere of the
chambers and the drive through the comparatively
fresh air somewhat revived Herriard, and by the time
they reached Green Street he had resolved upon the
course he would take. Alexia was alone; how glad she
was to see him the love-light in her eyes told him, and
his heart sank, he felt bitterly resentful against fate at
the thought of the evil of which he was the messenger.
Count Prosper was not long in tactfully remembering
some work he had to finish, and left the lovers
together.</p>

<p>&#8220;Geoffrey,&#8221; Alexia said, looking into the face just
raised from a kiss, &#8220;you are not yourself to-night, you
are troubled: tell me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took a few restless steps. &#8220;I am worried,&#8221; he
answered, &#8220;and more, I have news which must trouble
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She rose to her feet and stood looking at him, her
eyes full of a vague apprehension, yet scarcely fear.
&#8220;Geoffrey,&#8221; she said in a low, steady voice, &#8220;tell me:
tell me at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>He hesitated a moment as though calculating the
danger of the shock. Then he spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Paul Gastineau&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gastineau?&#8221; She almost gasped, and her face went
white.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is alive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; Her lips closed tightly. The effort was to
steady herself and realize what the news portended.
With characteristic delicacy Herriard waited in silence.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
In that moment he would not emphasize, he dared not
soften, the import of the news.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have seen him?&#8221; she asked at length.</p>

<p>He nodded. Then came near, took her in his arms
and kissed her. &#8220;My darling! Mine!&#8221; he murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;Geoffrey, tell me,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hardly dare tell you,&#8221; he replied, as the possible
consequence of his confession sent a shiver of fear
through him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, he is the same terribly hateful, determined man
as ever.&#8221; She gave a slight shudder. &#8220;So the man
who told Prosper he had seen him was right after all.
But you, Geoffrey; how did you encounter him? You
said you did not know him in the old days, before his
supposed death. Tell me quickly. I cannot understand
what has happened.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took her hand as they sat together. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know how I can tell you,&#8221; he said, in a troubled voice.
&#8220;For my story involves a confession; a hateful confession
which may rob me of the thing I hold dearest in
the world. Yet I must tell you everything, everything,
and trust to your nobleness, to your love to judge me
fairly. Promise me you will not condemn me till you
have heard the whole history. I swear to you I will
keep back nothing, extenuate nothing: you shall know
the story as I know it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The hand which lay in his gave a little pressure of
confidence, and with that he released it. At least he
would spare her&mdash;and himself&mdash;the pain of taking it
away. Then he told her everything of his life since
his first meeting with Gastineau: told his story shortly,
succinctly, yet, as he had promised, omitting nothing
of importance, nothing that an enemy or his own conscience<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
would have bade him tell. Alexia listened with
half-averted face. Now and again she broke in with
an exclamation of wonder, for the tale was surely one
of the strangest that ever woman heard from her lover&#8217;s
lips; once or twice she asked a question for an explanation
of Gastineau&#8217;s almost incredible procedure; that
was all. She heard him without sign of impatience to
the end, and he could not tell, dared not seek to anticipate
his story&#8217;s effect upon her. Yet he feared. The
account of the accident, their meeting, and the supposititious
death of Gastineau was plain, though dramatic
enough; the suggestion of the singular partnership did
not seem greatly to exceed the relations of coach and
pupil; but, viewed in the light of its effects, of the moral
situation to which it had driven Herriard, of the vindictive
use to which Gastineau had constantly put his
pupil, of the fraud and falsehood that lay behind Herriard&#8217;s
career, none the less dishonest in that their only
bad effect was the injury to himself, all this when related
plainly seemed horribly condemnatory. Still, he
stuck unflinchingly to his task, feeling that nothing but
truth must exist between him and his love; and, besides,
this was the only, yet the least, atonement he
could make.</p>

<p>It was only when he had come to an end of his unvarnished
story that he let his tone change to pleading.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you knew, my love,&#8221; he said, passionately remorseful,
&#8220;how I have hated myself for these years
of falsehood, how I fought against the temptation to
declare my love, knowing I was unworthy of yours,
till at last it was too strong to resist, you would pity
me. And you must know that with my love came the
determination to end the situation regardless of consequences,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
to strip off the bonds of deception that bound
me. The release has come, thank God, and I am a
free man, and you are, if it must be, a free woman,
whose path need never run with mine again.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused, hanging on her answer. To his unspeakable
joy her hand was laid on his, and, as he turned,
he read nothing but love in her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alexia!&#8221; he cried, in the delicious release from a
great fear; and next moment was on his knees by her
side kissing her. &#8220;And you can still love me?&#8221; he
murmured.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; she replied. &#8220;What bar is it between
us that you have been led into and caught in a false
position by the most plausible, unprincipled brain in
the world?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the living lie that I have been,&#8221; he urged, resolved
that nothing should be glossed over, and feeling
a prompt forgiveness was more than he deserved.</p>

<p>She gave a smile of sweet protest. &#8220;That is hardly
my judgment of you. It does not follow because Geoffrey
Herriard is, happily, not the intellectual equal of
Paul Gastineau he is not a clever man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At least,&#8221; he said, allowing himself one favourable
word, &#8220;my conduct of your case was all my
own.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I gathered that,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;from your story,
and was glad to think it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If,&#8221; he continued, with a touch of bitterness, &#8220;it
had been he who, through my mouth, had won the day
for you, I don&#8217;t think I could ever have brought myself
to ask you to be my wife. But at least I was honest
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And clever, and brave, and chivalrous. And you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
thought, Geoffrey, that the woman who professed to
love you would have repaid all that by rejecting you
because she found you were enmeshed in the toils of our
common enemy? You might have known me better,
dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>Presently Herriard said, &#8220;I have at least one great
piece of good news for you. The man who killed Martindale
has been discovered.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Geoffrey!&#8221; Alexia&#8217;s face flushed with the joy of
that relief. &#8220;Tell me; who&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who but the one man in our thoughts, the man
whose evil personality hangs like a thunder-cloud over
our lives.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not Gastineau?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; Paul Gastineau.&#8221; Then he told her of Quickjohn&#8217;s
discovery, and of Gastineau&#8217;s visit and attack;
softening, however, the details of that terrible struggle,
in order to spare her anxiety and fear for the future.
As it was, she showed signs of a distress and a terror
too strong to be kept under.</p>

<p>&#8220;But now,&#8221; she said, brightening a little, &#8220;with this
man&#8217;s discovery, Gastineau&#8217;s power for evil is surely at
an end? You have only to inform the authorities that
he is alive, and they will arrest him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Herriard shook his head. &#8220;I doubt if they would
have a case. My experience of the law, my working
with Gastineau, have taught me that moral proof positive
may fall very far short of the legal evidence necessary
for a successful prosecution. No: it is quite convincing
to us&mdash;to you, to me and Quickjohn; but, I
fear, it is a noose that a less clever man than Paul
Gastineau would have little difficulty in slipping out of.
No one knows what happened in that room between the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
time of your leaving it and the discovery of Martindale&#8217;s
death, except the one man whom we believed to have
killed him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And he would kill you, Geoffrey,&#8221; she said, in terror
at the thought.</p>

<p>He shook his head reassuringly. &#8220;I think not,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;For one thing, I am on my guard and can
take care of myself, and, besides, I do not think he
will attempt to attack me again. He knows I can,
at least, invoke the aid of the law there, and he would
scarcely care, in his present position, to run that
risk.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alexia seemed to take comfort from his assumption
of confidence. He knew, however, all the same, that
nothing was more likely than that Gastineau was meditating
another attack, and that his own life, except
as far as he could protect it, might scarcely be worth
a day&#8217;s purchase.</p>

<p>Herriard, feeling in little humour for his own company
that night, was glad to sit and smoke with Count
Prosper till a late hour. It had been arranged before
Alexia had left them that the marriage should take
place almost immediately and that a long honeymoon
should be spent on the Count&#8217;s estate in Moravia. One
thing intervened, and that was an engagement Herriard
had made to give his annual address to his constituents
at Bradbury. This was an annoying hindrance, but it
was a binding obligation on Herriard, and, after all, it
meant but a week&#8217;s extra delay, which would give little
more time than was needed for him to make a temporary
wind-up of his business, legal and parliamentary.
With the deadly point hanging over him, however, every
moment seemed to count now against the chance of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
finally securing his happiness: to his impatience already,
even, the inevitable interval seemed a gulf that he could
scarcely hope to cross.</p>

<p>However, their plans were, so far, settled satisfactorily,
even happily. Count Prosper gave his guest a glowing
account of his Austrian home, with the promise of
much romantic scenery and good sport. At length
Herriard bade him good-night and strolled off towards
his rooms, his mind a vortex of doubt, of joy, of fear.
What would be Gastineau&#8217;s next move? He had declared
in his masterful fashion that he would not be
robbed of that treasure which was never his, Alexia.
Still, with a man of Gastineau&#8217;s resource and strength
of will to covet was to possess. In the days of their
partnership, now, it seemed, an age back, he had often
declared that to a man of abnormal will-power, once
in deadly earnest, to desire was to have; whatever the
object to be attained might be, however high it might
seem above his reach. And that force was working now
against him; what could his own devoted love count in
opposition to the tremendous energy of that tenacious,
unconquerable will?</p>

<p>Depressed with these thoughts, he had reached his
door, when a man suddenly emerging from the shadow
of a portico confronted him. He was sure, before he
recognized him, that it was the man in his thoughts,
Paul Gastineau. Happily he had taken the precaution
to borrow, on a plausible excuse, Count Prosper&#8217;s revolver,
resolving to buy one for himself next day. At
the sight of Gastineau he whipped it out and held it
outstretched before him. Gastineau laughed. As the
light of a street lamp fell on his face he seemed in quite
a pleasant, even jocular, mood; no trace remained of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
the devilish countenance that had looked down at Herriard
a few hours before with murder written plain upon
it. Now the smile was not even cynical.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Geoffrey,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;please don&#8217;t be
so truculent. I hope we have both recovered from our
late madness. I have been waiting for you here, having
forfeited the right to expect you to receive me indoors.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You could hardly expect that,&#8221; replied Herriard,
regarding with repugnant wonder the almost incredible
assurance of the callous, insouciant incarnation of malignity
who stood smiling before him. &#8220;I wish to have
nothing more to say to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Naturally,&#8221; Gastineau laughed. &#8220;All the same I
shall be obliged if you will listen to a word from me.
A question. Are you going to mention our late unfortunate
set-to to your friend Quickjohn? I ask merely
for information.&#8221; He spoke quite casually, as though
careless what the answer might be.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not thought of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; Gastineau exclaimed, with a smile of patronizing
doubt. &#8220;Or that I am in the land of the living?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor that, as yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! Now, my dear Herriard,&#8221; he went on in his
easy tone, with just a suspicion of restrained mockery
behind it, &#8220;I don&#8217;t expect you to take advice from me
any longer, and I am perfectly ready to meet any contingency;
at the same time I am here to offer you&mdash;shall
we say an armistice?&mdash;and to suggest that to make
a fuss about my little explosion of temper would not be
a wise thing to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose that is a threat,&#8221; Herriard said sternly;
&#8220;if so&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>&#8220;A threat?&#8221; Gastineau raised a deprecating hand.
&#8220;My dear fellow! The idea of threatening an angry
man who stands over you with a loaded&mdash;presumably
loaded&mdash;revolver in his hand! It is nothing but a piece
of common-sense advice, of which the most cocksure
of us occasionally stand in need. Perhaps I ought to
explain why mine is worth considering; the question,
that is, of leaving well&mdash;or ill&mdash;alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want your advice, Gastineau, of all men&#8217;s,&#8221;
Herriard said.</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet,&#8221; the other retorted, gently persuasive,
&#8220;I am, so far, the only man capable of giving advice
in the present crisis. You had better hear what I have
to say. Please be careful of that revolver. If you
mean to shoot, shoot; but I should hate to have an
accidental bullet through me. Now, the world, my
dear Herriard, is, putting aside for the moment our
little difference, wide enough for both of us. It is not
likely that I shall come back to that stuffy, crowded
square mile on which I formerly and you lately have
bustled and quibbled and sweated. I have lost nearly
five working years of my life; I must make them up,
and the great West, my dear Geoffrey, offers me the
best chance of overtaking them. There is a fortune for
me in five years over there. And the American intellect
attracts me; I long to pit myself against it; I have
never been fully extended here; was brought into the
world for worthier competitors than your slow, stupid
Englishmen; I&#8217;m sick of fighting rapier against bludgeon.
So, as at present advised, I am off.&#8221;</p>

<p>Herriard bowed acceptance of the statement.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you might like to know,&#8221; Gastineau went
on lightly. &#8220;No doubt you regard me as a dangerous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
element in your atmosphere; an active enemy, eh? Well,
perhaps I might be if it were worth my while; but five
minutes&#8217; reflection will surely show you that it isn&#8217;t.
That&#8217;s all. Good-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>To Herriard&#8217;s relief he turned to go; then stopped.
&#8220;By the way, as we are not likely to meet again, you
are still bent on marrying the lady?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; Herriard answered curtly.</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m! A mistake, my dear friend, and a mistake
that will probably make all the difference. Blind obstinacy
has led many a better man than you or I over
a precipice. The clever man is he who knows when to
abandon an untenable or dangerous position. Well,
may you be wise before wisdom has gone beyond recall.
I shall say no more. For the last time, good-night and
good-bye.&#8221;</p>

<p>He nodded, indifferent as to whether his bidding were
returned, and so went off at a saunter down the street.
Herriard lingered in the shadow of his doorway, watching
him till he had disappeared into the night.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV<br />


<small>A RIOT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ON the appointed day Herriard journeyed down to
address his constituents at Bradbury. Since their
meeting in Mount Street, he had seen or heard nothing
of Gastineau. He had, however, kept on his guard
through the busy days that followed, being too wary
and too suspicious of Gastineau&#8217;s methods to be lulled
into the belief that the active will was not still working
against him. Nevertheless, as the days went by without
a sign of Gastineau, or a suggestion of his aggressive
enmity, days which brought him nearer and nearer to
that supreme hour to which he scarcely dared look forward,
his mind grew easier, and he found himself entertaining
the hope that, after all, his enemy might, in his
speech with him in the gate, have declared his real
intentions, and that he would be troubled by him no
more. Gastineau&#8217;s declared project of betaking himself
to America was, at least, reasonable and likely
enough. He had in the old days over and over again
expressed his utter contempt for his English compeers,
and told how, in his active life, he had longed for adversaries
more worthy of his skill in fence. Then, allowing
it to be quite possible that, with the memory of his
former reputation, with his talent and determination,
it would be a comparatively easy task for him to push
himself again into the foremost place which he had once
occupied, he would probably be withheld by the consideration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
that it might be now as a man under the
cloud of a dark suspicion that he would stand forth.
It was hardly to be supposed that Quickjohn&#8217;s theory
would be allowed to slumber in silence. No; Paul Gastineau
was assuredly too astute and too clear-sighted a
man not to see that a second career in England was
closed to him. His having lain for years <i>perdu</i> under
an assumed name, having allowed the false report of his
death to pass uncontradicted, would be in itself a salient
cause of suspicion. Englishmen have ever fought shy,
in public life at least, of men whose record was smirched
with doubt. Few men, if any, have succeeded in living
down an ugly scandal to the extent of gaining unreserved
acceptance in a public career. Whatever the
private lives of the units of out-door opinion may be,
they are at least jealous of crooked ways leading to high
places.</p>

<p>Reasoning thus, Herriard allowed his uneasiness to
diminish, and, as the time of his marriage drew near,
was able to indulge in a certain sense of happiness and
security. It was in this mood that on the day appointed
for his speech he journeyed down to Bradbury. On his
arrival he had a good deal of business to get through
with his agent and principal supporters, and this kept
his mind so occupied that he gave scarcely a thought
to the more momentous issues which he had left behind
in town. He was, however, brought back to them in
somewhat startling fashion when, on driving from his
hotel to the hall where the meeting was to be held, he
caught sight of a face, which was uncomfortably familiar
to him, that of Hencher, Gastineau&#8217;s confidential body
servant. But, after the first start it gave him, the idea
of the man&#8217;s being there seemed so unlikely, and even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
preposterous, that he told himself he must have made
a mistake; the Gastineau business was on his nerves,
and had made him recognize Hencher in a somewhat
similar-looking local man. Still, knowing Gastineau,
and the subtle, enterprising methods of his vindictiveness,
the idea gave him recurrent disquietude, and, try
as he would, he could not dismiss from his mind the
possibility that the man he had seen was really
Hencher, and that his presence there foreboded mischief.</p>

<p>Up to the opening of the proceedings there had been
no hint or idea of opposition, but soon after the business
had commenced it became apparent that there was
what seemed an organized band of malcontents in the
body of the hall who meant to take every opportunity
of interrupting the speeches. This opposition manifested
itself unmistakably when Herriard rose to give
his address, and as he proceeded the noise and interruptions
grew more insistent. The chairman was powerless
to preserve order, and, as the organizers of the meeting
had anticipated no sort of disturbance, they had taken
no pains to provide against such a contingency. There
were a number of ill-looking fellows distributed about
the hall who kept a running fire of interruptions; as
soon as one set was silenced, the game was taken up
by others in a different quarter. At last the disturbance
reached such a pitch that Herriard was unable to make
himself heard, and to continue speaking was clearly
futile. At this juncture two or three stray policemen
were brought in with the object of ejecting, or, at least,
overawing, the rowdy element. It, however, proved to
be the means of bringing the uproar to a climax. A
provincial policeman is usually only in a limited and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
constructive sense typical of the Law. These poor men,
received with a derisive roar, stood looking rather foolish
and conspicuously incompetent to deal with the situation.
The disturbers of the meeting rose at them
with defiance and threats, also with chaff of an aggressively
personal nature. In the midst of all this the purpose
of the meeting, which was Herriard&#8217;s address,
became a thing of naught; so he and his supporters on
the platform sat down to await the result of the row
in more or less patient helplessness.</p>

<p>Suddenly a whistle sounded through the hall, and
with an ominously threatening cry the malcontents in
all parts of the audience turned and began to fight
their way towards the platform.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look out! They are going to storm us!&#8221; cried the
chairman, a pompous linen-draper and former mayor,
who in days of calm was wont to consider himself the
ruling spirit of the town. &#8220;We had better take care
of ourselves and our hats,&#8221; he added with a ghastly
attempt at jocularity and self-possession. His pomposity
had gone like the gas in a burst balloon; he was in
an abject state of terror, and incapable of making a
dignified retreat. All the idea he now retained of his
position as chairman was that it gave him an excuse
for leading the way; so, although there were ladies on
the platform, he pushed through them with a quavering,
&#8220;Follow me!&#8221; and hurried off. Herriard stood facing
the storming party, and looking on with disgust at the
free fight now raging in the body of the hall. But the
struggle was unequal, the well-disposed members of the
audience, although in the majority, were no match for
the rowdy element of roughs and, it seemed, hired bullies.
The outwork of the reporters&#8217; table was stormed;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
from that it was but an easy leap to the platform where
Herriard still stood defiantly.</p>

<p>A man touched his arm, one of the more plucky among
the officials. &#8220;Come away, Mr. Herriard, quick! You
can do no good by remaining here. The meeting is
thoroughly demoralized. We can do nothing now. It
is all over.&#8221;</p>

<p>Reluctantly, with the annoying sense of a wasted
effort and lost days, Herriard turned and let himself
be hurried from the platform just as a savage cry of
exultation announced that the foremost of the attacking
party had gained a footing on it. In the ante-room
he was met by Mr. Rigglesden, his chairman, coming
back with a white face.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are cut off,&#8221; he exclaimed, shaking with fear.
&#8220;The street outside is full of the blackguards. We are
in a trap.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense,&#8221; said Herriard impatiently, as he pushed
past the abject local worthy. &#8220;Let me speak to them;
I&#8217;ll bring them to their senses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No use,&#8221; groaned the quondam mayor. &#8220;I know
our Bradbury rowdies. They are terrors when their
blood&#8217;s up, and have no senses to be brought back to.
Mr. Carter and gentlemen, for Heaven&#8217;s sake keep that
door. To let them in from the hall will be as much as
our lives are worth.&#8221;</p>

<p>For the man who had brought Herriard from the
platform was, with three other young fellows, holding
the door that led down from the platform against the
savage efforts that were being made to force it open.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Herriard had pushed his way through the
frightened group to the outer door. He made its custodian
unlock it, and so, passing through, he presented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
himself before the vicious mob outside. His appearance
was the signal for a shout and an ugly rush. He tried
to speak, but his voice was drowned by the howls, and
he was forced back into the doorway by the assault.
Blows were aimed at him, and he saw that reasoning
was futile and courage of no avail against what was
clearly an organized attack. So he retreated, and then
engaged with his supporters in a struggle to hold the
door against the crowd which were flinging themselves
against it. In the midst of this fierce effort, mingled
cries of terror and triumph behind them told that the
inner door from the hall had at length been forced and
that the roughs were streaming into the ante-room.
The cries increased to shrieks and shouts, the crush became
terrible, but through it the ruffians were successfully
forcing their way to the outer door. Herriard,
hemmed in, turned and hit out desperately. &#8220;Down
him!&#8221; came a cry. Next moment an arm encircled
his throat from behind. By an effort he half turned,
ducked, and freed himself from the clutch. But as he
raised his head again he received a heavy blow on it
and dropped senseless to the floor.</p>

<small>ALEXIA&#8217;S VISITOR</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ON that same evening in London it was announced
to Countess Alexia that a Mr. Maxton was in the
morning-room waiting to see her on urgent business.
Her brother was not at home, being away at a diplomatic
function. Alexia had dined alone and was now
busy answering a batch of letters of congratulation
which the news of her approaching marriage had brought.
She sent down a request to know on what business so
late a visitor wished to see her, and word was brought
back that it concerned Mr. Herriard and was most urgent.
Not satisfied with that reply and beginning to
be vaguely suspicious, Alexia sent to say that she was
busy and would be glad if Mr. Maxton would give her
in writing a more definite idea of what he wished to say.
In a few minutes the suggested note was handed to her.
She opened it with some apprehension. It consisted of
but two lines. &#8220;Mr. Herriard has met with a serious
accident at Bradbury.&#8221;</p>

<p>Fighting against the faintness that came over her
as she realized instantly that the news might be but
half told, she said she would see the visitor, and, after a
few moments of sickening fear, nerving herself bravely
to hear the worst, she went down to the room where the
messenger of evil waited.</p>

<p>As she entered, the man was standing with his back
to the door, scrutinizing a picture. It was not till<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
Alexia had come some way into the room that he turned,
and with a thrill more of disgust than fear she recognized
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Gastineau!&#8221;</p>

<p>He smiled and took a step towards her, holding out
his hand. &#8220;Paul Gastineau, Countess, risen from the
dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>She ignored his outstretched hand, affecting to look
at his note which she held. &#8220;You have come to tell
me of Mr. Herriard?&#8221; she said, hoping now that the
message might have been but a trick to induce her to
see him. &#8220;He has met with an accident?&#8221; she asked,
with a touch of incredulity.</p>

<p>Gastineau gave a little sympathetic shrug. &#8220;Poor
Geoffrey! Yes, I&#8217;m afraid he has had a bad experience.
I have had a telegram&mdash;you know we have of late been
great chums, if not more&mdash;a telegram to say the meeting
was broken up and Herriard hurt. I thought I could
do no less than come round to tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Looking at him steadily, she told herself that he was
lying. &#8220;You need not have brought the message yourself;
you might have sent it,&#8221; she observed coldly.</p>

<p>He was evidently stung by her tone, for he returned,
with a touch of feeling, &#8220;In view of the relations which
I understand exist between you and Herriard I should
scarcely have cared to give you what may prove to be
very serious news in an off-hand fashion. I regret that
my well-meant errand has met with so ungracious a
reception.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry to hear that Mr. Herriard has been hurt,&#8221;
Alexia said stiffly. &#8220;Is that all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it not enough?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite. I mean, I will not detain you longer.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>&#8220;One would think, Countess,&#8221; he said quietly, watching
her with probing eyes, &#8220;that you were glad, rather
than sorry, to hear the bad news.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can hardly expect me to discuss with you my
feelings on the subject,&#8221; she returned, with a significant
move towards the bell.</p>

<p>He made a swift step forward and intercepted her.
&#8220;Alexia&mdash;Countess,&#8221; he said, with a note of passion in
his voice, &#8220;is this my welcome back to life?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What other,&#8221; she asked, coldly as ever, and with a
self-possession that hid her knowledge of how critical
the interview must be, &#8220;could you expect from me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had hoped,&#8221; he answered simply, &#8220;for one of
a very different kind.&#8221; Then his manner changed
abruptly with a bitter exclamation. &#8220;Welcome! As
though I had not atoned by years of hopeless agony
for all the sins of my past! Alexia!&#8221; He tried to take
her hand: she drew it away with a movement of avoidance.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said peremptorily; &#8220;I forbid you to speak
to me like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>He bowed his head in submission and so hid the
baulked devil that shot a blaze into his eyes. &#8220;I come
back to life and the world to find you as beautiful,
as cold, as cruel as ever,&#8221; he murmured, with schooled
humility.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot listen to you any longer,&#8221; Alexia said.
&#8220;Please go.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was facing her now with a look of fight in his
eyes. &#8220;My message to you,&#8221; he protested with quiet
insistence, &#8220;was two-fold. I warn you, for your own
sake and Geoffrey Herriard&#8217;s, not to dismiss me till you
have heard the second part.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>She gave a slight sigh of impatience. &#8220;If I must
listen to you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; And yet she felt that in her mind
there was no alternative.</p>

<p>&#8220;More depends upon it than you imagine,&#8221; he replied
coolly. &#8220;You shall not be kept long; I, too, am busy.&#8221;</p>

<p>He placed a chair for her, and, with an annoying
consciousness of submission, she sat down. A sense of
her old fear and dislike of the man was creeping over
her, and, giving her greater uneasiness still, the subduing
sense of his dominant will. It was fortunate,
she thought, that she had to act only on the defensive.
Still, it might afford a chance of divining the enemy&#8217;s
tactics.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had,&#8221; he began, as he stood before her in the
manifest consciousness of power in will and brain, &#8220;to
come in here under a false name; not merely because
I doubted your receiving me, but because Paul Gastineau
is to the world still dead, at least for some time
longer. So much for myself; I do not want you, of all
women, to think of me as a trickster. Now, to the
point of my errand. You are going&mdash;you must make
allowances for my bluntness, time presses and I am a
fighting man rather than a diplomatist,&mdash;you are going
to marry Geoffrey Herriard, very soon; but sooner or
later is immaterial. I have come,&mdash;forgive me,&mdash;to tell
you that you must not marry him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; The question was put quietly. Alexia
was surprised at her own self-possession.</p>

<p>Gastineau&#8217;s eyes seemed to burn upon her now. &#8220;Because,&#8221;
he answered steadily, &#8220;he has stolen, or, at
least, appropriated you from me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; she protested, meeting his gaze defiantly.
&#8220;That is absurd. You have no right to say that.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>&#8220;Then,&#8221; he rejoined, with his cunning smile, &#8220;because
I love you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; Alexia rose with an exclamation of annoyance.
&#8220;Mr. Gastineau, is that persecution to begin
again?&#8221;</p>

<p>His face was set with the suggestion of purpose.
&#8220;There will be no persecution on my part,&#8221; he replied
darkly. &#8220;I trust we are respectively too sensible to
practise or to court it. All I am here for now is to
enlighten you, the woman I love with all my soul and
strength, as to the true position in which you stand,
in a word, to prevent your taking the shadow for the
substance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I understand you,&#8221; she returned, with a
disdainful coldness which made him rage inwardly, &#8220;and
can save you the trouble of inflicting upon me a repetition
of a story which I have already heard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; He seemed nettled at his forestalling. &#8220;So
the famous Geoffrey Herriard has been clever enough
to see the desirability of making a clean breast of his
position before he was found out, and has confessed
that his cleverness has been borrowed&mdash;like his career&mdash;from
another man&#8217;s brains, eh? He has told you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gastineau&#8217;s face relaxed into a sneering smile. &#8220;I
am sorry to hear that, since it means that he has broken
his word of honour, a solemn promise made to me to
whom he owes everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think,&#8221; Alexia said quietly, &#8220;his course
was justified.&#8221;</p>

<p>He glanced at her sharply, and saw through her words
that she knew all. &#8220;No doubt,&#8221; he rejoined, &#8220;he would
try to justify it, but we need scarcely stay to argue that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
point. What I ask you to realize is the fact that you
are rejecting the real man in favour of his empty
mask.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not accept your estimate of Mr. Herriard,&#8221;
she replied curtly.</p>

<p>He seemed charged with the magnetism of a supreme,
coercive will, yet her coldness always held him at bay.
He could scarcely hope to argue successfully against
that baffling attitude of dislike.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish,&#8221; he continued, schooling his face and manner
to an insinuating humility, &#8220;that you would try to
find it in your heart to entertain a more favourable
estimate of me. Alexia,&#8221; he went on passionately,
tactfully taking no more than a step forward as he saw
her shrink from his advance, &#8220;let me call you once by
that name, if it is the last time; Alexia, why can you
not love me? What, in Heaven&#8217;s name, is the curse
upon me that gives hate in return where I have beggared
myself for love? Alexia,&#8221; he urged, with a passion
that now was genuine enough, &#8220;tell me, as one
human soul speaking to another, what there is in me
that repels you, you of all women, the last in the world
whom I could have imagined rejecting substance for
shadow. Tell me, even though it be to my utter despair,
tell me the truth, why do you so hate me?&#8221;</p>

<p>He was bending forward, his face working, his eyes
avidly pleading, his body quivering betwixt infinite desire
and intense restraint. Before him Alexia stood like
one at bay before a crouching tiger, desperate yet unflinching.
Perhaps had she not added the indication of
courage to beauty it might have lessened the deadliness
of the attack. As it was, she could meet his eyes and
answer steadily:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>&#8220;I never hated you till you began to persecute
me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Persecute!&#8221; he interrupted her impatiently, almost
with temper. &#8220;Cannot a man declare his love and do
all in his power to get it returned without being called
a persecutor?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is at least unchivalrous,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;to try to
compel a woman&#8217;s love. In the old days I could have
had none for you. Now it is more than ever impossible.&#8221;</p>

<p>His face lowered. &#8220;Since Herriard appeared on the
scene,&#8221; he said through his teeth. &#8220;Herriard, who is
my creature, the puppet of my whim, the marionette
that, lying on my sick couch, I made to dance to my
fancy, and have ended, to my sorrow, by galvanizing
into my rival.&#8221;</p>

<p>He spoke with an intensity of bitterness that seemed
to strip naked his jealous, malignant soul. But Alexia
appeared to take little heed of the stinging words. &#8220;Mr.
Herriard,&#8221; she said coolly, &#8220;has little or nothing to do
with my feeling towards you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No? Then we brush the lay figure aside out of our
consideration.&#8221; He accompanied the words with a contemptuous
sweep of the arm. &#8220;At least,&#8221; he continued,
&#8220;I am glad you realize that a mere speaking puppet
has no right to stand between intellects like yours and
mine. Now, tell me, what have I done to stand worse
with you now than in the old days?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have slandered me, Mr. Gastineau,&#8221; she answered
steadily.</p>

<p>He made a gesture of making light of a charge not
worth denying. &#8220;To the doll, to the child, to keep him
from meddling with what was meant for his betters,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
as we keep a baby&#8217;s hands off a valuable ornament by
saying it will bite him. Surely my presence here, the
words I have spoken to you, give the lie to the idea
that I could ever believe ill of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To my mind,&#8221; she retorted, &#8220;your slander, of all
men&#8217;s, gives the lie to what you have forced me to
listen to to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>A curious change swept over his face. He had realized,
even before she did, the half-thought that was
suggested by and lay behind her words.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are quite right,&#8221; he returned, with a strange
calming of the passion that had seemed to rage within
him. &#8220;Your reproach had more justice in it than you,
possibly, imagine. I should have been the last man to
accuse you even by innuendo. But I was desperate, a
cripple, helpless and, at that time, hopeless. My love
made me mad with jealousy, and it is the curse of jealousy
that it can be cruel even to the thing it loves. To
think that a feather of my own disabled wing had plumed
the shaft that had struck my heart&mdash;yes, Alexia, I must
have been mad, or I could never have breathed a suggestion
against the woman whom I love beyond the
power of all words to tell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And whose offence, whose provocation in your eyes
are that she can never return the feeling,&#8221; she said with
quiet firmness.</p>

<p>He bowed his head, strangely submissive. &#8220;I do
not despair,&#8221; he replied, in a low voice. &#8220;I cannot.
Despair would mean death, and life is strong within
me; only less strong than my love. That I have laid
at your feet, only to be accepted with hate and distrust.
I will prove my sincerity. I will put the other,
my life, into your keeping. Then you will have all I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
have, since, with my love, my very soul and spirit are
yours. Alexia, I give my life into your hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused; and the silence lasted till she was forced
to ask, with a suggestion of incredulity, &#8220;What do you
mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean,&#8221; he answered deliberately, &#8220;that I am going
to prove the sincerity of my love for you by entrusting
you with a secret on which my life may depend. You
must believe in me, when I confide to you alone of all
the world that Captain Martindale met his death at my
hand.&#8221;</p>

<small>THE END OF THE INTERVIEW</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE declaration, although no news to Alexia, was,
coming as it did, startlingly unexpected. It was,
moreover, as she instinctively realized, a cunning move
which forced her into an embarrassing position. But
she gave no sign that she was already aware of the
crucial fact. &#8220;Yours?&#8221; she exclaimed in a tone of
horror which was not altogether affected. &#8220;You killed
Captain Martindale?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gastineau nodded. His face bore a look almost of
sympathetic amusement at her concern. &#8220;By what
was practically an accident,&#8221; he answered; &#8220;although
it might be hard to prove that. It is due to myself now
to tell you exactly how it happened. Do sit down,&#8221;
he continued, with an easy smile, as he pushed a chair
towards her. &#8220;You need not be afraid of me; on the
contrary, it is I who might fear you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He moved away from her chair, and she sat down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; he began, &#8220;you remember the night of
the Vaux House ball, and, perhaps, what had passed
between us just before. I will not inflict upon you a
description of my state of mind at that time, except to
say that I was mad for love of you. I have nothing
if not strength of will, yet it all shrivelled to naught
where you were concerned; strive as I would, I could
not overcome the love which tortured me a million<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
times more than, as I felt to my shame and grief, it
troubled and offended you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He spoke, urged by present rather than past passion;
eagerly as he was watching for it, he could detect no
sign that his burning words touched her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I went,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;to Vaux House that night
desperately determined to make one last effort for&mdash;no,
not for your love, that I knew to be a miracle beyond
that night&#8217;s working&mdash;but for your toleration; for
a kind look, a smile, a dance, the touch of your hand,
the sound of your voice; just a crumb, even to the
mocking of my hunger.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused. Alexia sat with averted face, motionless
as a statue, yet with the suggestion of being keenly
attentive. If he expected her to speak, her attitude
never flattered him that she would break her silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I little knew,&#8221; he resumed, &#8220;to what fate I was
going. That the racking torture I suffered could be
heightened was inconceivable. Ah! I never imagined
then the depths of despair, and worse, to which love
can lead a man. Up to the moment I entered Vaux
House I had suffered, Heaven knows how greatly, from
your coldness, from your rejection of all my advances,
from, as I flattered myself, your misjudgment of me,
but, except negatively, I had been free from the hell&#8217;s
torture of jealousy. Now you can comprehend something
of my mind on that fateful night?&#8221;</p>

<p>She made, almost indifferently, a slight inclination of
the head; not looking towards him, or giving any further
sign of sympathy.</p>

<p>He proceeded. &#8220;My story shall not be long now.
I saw you, and watched you dancing, watched you enviously,
longingly. Still there was just a spark left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
in the ashes of my hopes, which at our first meeting
had blazed up so brightly. I was awaiting my opportunity,
and presently it seemed to have come. I had
seen you leave the ball-room; I slipped out by another
door intending to make my way round and meet you;
anticipating, hoping that, by biding my time, I might
find you alone. Accordingly I worked my way round
by the outer suite of rooms till I came to the point
where I calculated we might meet. I was not wrong.
I saw you in the room beyond with two men, one of
whom was Captain Martindale. The other man went
away; you and Martindale spoke together, and then,
evidently at his suggestion, you and he strolled towards
an inner room, a flirtation corner. You remember?&#8221;</p>

<p>Again she nodded gravely, speaking no word. &#8220;You
did not notice me,&#8221; Gastineau resumed. &#8220;Your talk
with Martindale was too engrossing; confidential enough
to make me burn with jealousy. At the door of the
inner room you hesitated. It was natural, having regard
to your partner&#8217;s reputation. He laid his hand
upon your arm, urging you to go in. You shook off
his grasp&mdash;there was a thrill of satisfaction to me in
that,&mdash;he went on a pace, persuading you to follow.
I watched anxiously for the result, meaning to accost
you should you turn back. But he prevailed, and you
went slowly after him into the room. Ah! how I hated
him! How I tried to think the worse of you for yielding.
I quietly crossed the room to the doorway through
which you had disappeared, my mad jealousy making
me careless of what I did. At the door I stopped and
listened. I could hear your voices in the room beyond,
but not your words. Making a slight change in my position,
my foot touched something hard on the carpet.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
It was the little jewelled sword, the hair ornament. Instantly
I recognized it as yours; you may be sure that
every detail of your appearance was familiar to me.
I took it up eagerly. At last, Countess, you have the
solution of that element in the mystery.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; The monosyllable sounded cold, almost resentful.</p>

<p>&#8220;Chance,&#8221; he continued, as coolly now as though
he were opening a case in Court, &#8220;had given me an
excuse for breaking in upon your flirtation, of spoiling
Martindale&#8217;s opportunity, but jealousy kept me back;
hurry would spoil my chance of appearing at the critical
moment. I tried to catch a glimpse of you, but
could not; to have passed through the doorway would
have meant to show myself. But I saw in my difficulty
that there seemed to be another entrance to the
room. If I could get round that way I might hear
what Martindale was saying. The thought uppermost
in my mind was to protect you from him, a man of
notoriously bad principles where women were concerned;
you may believe me, Countess, when I say that jealousy
did not altogether account for my resolve to intervene.
It was bad enough to fail to win you; to lose you to a
man of Martindale&#8217;s character was not to be endured.
I went quickly back and through another room which
I knew must lead from that in which you stayed. I
opened the communicating door quietly; as luck would
have it a porti&egrave;re hung beyond it; behind this I could
stand, in the room, yet unseen. I am telling you everything,
Countess, exactly as it happened; palliating nothing,
excusing nothing, save on the ground of the devouring
love that had possession of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>If he looked for a softening of her attitude, none was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
visible; it was simply attentive without a sign of feeling.
&#8220;I stood there,&#8221; he resumed, as though now desirous
to make an end quickly, &#8220;listening with jealous ears.
Your voices were so low that I could hear little of your
talk, which was all the worse for my state of mind.
But presently a word reached my ears like a stab. It
stung me out of my restraint. I pulled aside the curtain
and looked into the room. I saw&mdash;the kiss.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Without knowing what led up to it.&#8221; Alexia spoke
in a level voice, as though forced to suggest in her justification
another than the obvious reason.</p>

<p>Gastineau continued. &#8220;You left him then quickly;
and, to my surprise, he did not follow. I could just
see the self-satisfied look on his face as he stood looking
after you. It was that look that kept me there till he
noticed me. I suppose he gathered from my expression
what I had heard and seen; anyhow he began to
abuse and insult me&mdash;after the manner of an empty-headed
Guardsman who had been caught playing a disreputable
game. I replied hotly enough; my rage and
jealous hate were beyond restraint; as to being an
eavesdropper, I had as much right there as he; he, a
dishonourable Philander, had everything to be ashamed
of; I nothing. I waited for a break in the somewhat
sharp sarcasm with which he assailed me, and then
began, in the most stinging language my profession had
taught me, to paint his character, his reputation as I
then saw it. I dare say he had never before had such
taunts flung at him. I stung him into a state of speechless
rage; the few retorts he had attempted were feeble
and simply furnished me with fresh turns of recrimination.
As his temper rose, mine fell; for I began to
enjoy the castigation I was giving him. At last the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
cutting slashes of my tongue whipped him beyond endurance.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;You&mdash;&mdash;!&#8217; he cried, choking with rage. &#8216;I&#8217;ll
teach you to insult me; I&#8217;ll show you the difference
between a soldier and a wretched limb of the law; I&#8217;ll
shake the miserable life out of you.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;He came up and took me by the throat. I am not a
physically weak man, and he found me stronger than
he had imagined. I released myself from his grip without
much difficulty. This enraged him still more; he
was one of those stupid men who cannot bear to have
their self-constituted superiority put in question. With
insulting words, he attacked me again, but our first encounter
had brought to my recollection that I still held
in my hand your little sword. I had no wish for a
further contest, so retreated a few steps as he advanced
upon me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Keep off, you great bully!&#8217; I said. &#8216;If you lay
hands on me again it will be the worse for you. A
pity you cannot behave yourself towards either women
or men.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Following me up with a vicious look in his eyes,
Martindale made a sudden rush forward and seized me
again by the throat, this time with both hands. &#8216;I&#8217;ll
teach you to spy upon me, you skunk: I&#8217;ll spoil your
game before you get the chance of spoiling mine again.&#8217;
His big, strong hands encircled my throat, one from the
front and the other from behind; the clutch became so
vicious that I could not breathe; the man was, I knew,
mad with rage; honestly I thought he would strangle
me. Against the terrible grip I could do nothing; all
power was leaving me with my breath; the agony became
intense, it was that of death; my mind became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
suddenly clear as a dying man&#8217;s, and, with the sudden
flash of hyper-consciousness, I remembered again the
little weapon I still clutched. On the instant I struck
out at him with it, in a last despairing effort, with all
the strength that was left me. So little did I count on
the effectiveness of the stroke, that it was with surprise
I felt the grip round my throat almost simultaneously
relax. Martindale gave a kind of choking sigh, and fell
forward upon me. Reeling with faintness, I had just
strength enough to break his fall to the floor; he slid
down through my arms and lay there, dead. That is
all; the rest is known to the world. It is good of you
to have listened so patiently to my long story. But I
owe it to myself, if not to you, to convince you that I
am not quite a murderer, and at the same time to give
you the true account of how Martindale came by his
death.&#8221;</p>

<p>He waited for her response. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, breaking
at last the tenseness of her attitude; &#8220;I am glad to
know how it really happened.&#8221; For the first time she
let her eyes rest on his face, but, though his own seemed
to search for it, there was no suggestion of tenderness
or invitation in them.</p>

<p>He took a step towards her. &#8220;I hope,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it
may make all the difference in our relations to each
other.&#8221;</p>

<p>The grey eyes hardened now. &#8220;If you mean that
we should be more than comparative strangers, that
cannot be.&#8221;</p>

<p>She spoke boldly, and he wondered whether her spirit
could be as brave as her words.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed,&#8221; he returned, with a smile of underlying
resolve, &#8220;we must be more than that.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>&#8220;Must?&#8221; She repeated the word with a little scornful
laugh. Then with more dignity, &#8220;You surely forget
yourself to say that to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I tell you,&#8221; he spoke more humbly, &#8220;why I
used the word?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her only answer was a shrug of impatience, indifference.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;because I feel certain, am
absolutely convinced that you and I, united, would be
a great power in this world of ours. That there are no
two people living to-day whose alliance would lead to
a more splendid position. When I speak of power, I
mean intellectual, social, political; a power in everything
that could work for the good we should choose;
in a very few years our influence would be unbounded,
our wealth and position more than sufficient for every
aim. This is not the mere vapouring of a man&#8217;s vanity.
I know and feel my power, it would be absurd affectation
to shut my eyes to what I have already accomplished.
Take but one instance. When lately I was
lying half-dead on a couch from which I never thought
to rise, I made another man&#8217;s career, young Herriard&#8217;s;
pushed him, without an effort, in a whim of mere gratitude
for a slight service rendered me, pushed him into
a brilliant position, as easily as I could move a piece
on a chess-board. You know that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I understand that,&#8221; she answered, almost
mechanically.</p>

<p>&#8220;So I am justified,&#8221; Gastineau resumed, his pleading
growing more urgent, &#8220;in saying that, now my health
is restored, nothing can stop me; the force that drives
me through the throng of my fellows is irresistible. If
only you were by my side, the world would be at our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
feet; since, allied, we should represent the great forces
that have ever moved, will ever move it. Countess&mdash;Alexia,
forgive my boldness when I tell you that we,
you and I, have no right, it would be an act of short-sighted
folly, to throw ourselves away on inferior mates.
You must know this, you who are so clever, who can
read men and the world; I cannot imagine that you can
be blind to the hideous mistake you would commit in
allying yourself to a mere puppet, a weakling, the simulacrum
of a man, such as Geoffrey Herriard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Gastineau,&#8221; Alexia interrupted him with
scarcely restrained indignation. &#8220;I can listen to this
language no longer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you must, Countess,&#8221; he returned insistently.
&#8220;I am bound to put the question, the chance of your
future with its unparalleled prospects, before you
plainly, even at the risk of offence. I have in this
touched only on the worldly reasons for our alliance,
intruding no word of love; of mine which fills my whole
being, making me your slave, your adoring worshipper;
of yours which I feel in my heart will come to be mine
one day. Countess, can you reject me now? Have I not
been frank, and laid bare my heart and very soul and
the terrible secret of my life before you? Alexia, put
away all these vain fancies and prejudices; accept the
power, the empire which I cast at your feet, and
tell me you will be my wife.&#8221; As the note of passion
deepened he tried, making a swift approach, to clasp
her in his arms, but she drew herself up proudly and
repulsed him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alexia,&#8221; he urged, desperately intent, &#8220;I will give
you power beyond every other woman in the kingdom,
I will raise you to a height more dazzling than you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
dream of. It shall be my one object in life, I swear it.
Don&#8217;t, don&#8217;t reject me. Think what you refuse. Oh,&#8221;
he cried, almost savagely, as her attitude grew even
more repelling, &#8220;tell me what it is that makes you hate
me so. Have I not confessed the truth to you, and
purged the taint of blood-guiltiness from my soul?
Alexia,&#8221; he demanded, with passionate fierceness, &#8220;tell
me! You shall tell me.&#8221;</p>

<p>But she gave no sign of faltering before the tempest
of his insistence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Gastineau,&#8221; she said, as coldly as the situation
permitted, and with more than a touch of decision,
&#8220;this interview has lasted long enough, too long. Let
it come to an end now. No good purpose can be served
by my listening to you any longer. Understand once,
and for all time, that under no circumstances can I
accept your proposal, which is made dishonourable by
the very fact of my engagement to Mr. Herriard. That
is all I have to say to you. Please go.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gastineau&#8217;s face had been dark with a strong man&#8217;s
repressed anger; now it lightened strangely as with the
anticipation of a premeditated stroke. &#8220;Then you
reject my offer, Countess, absolutely?&#8221; he demanded
quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Absolutely.&#8221; The grey eyes met his steadily,
without a sign of compromise. And in his there was
no acceptance of defeat, but rather a challenge.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have asked you to do nothing dishonourable,
Countess,&#8221; he said calmly, &#8220;knowing, as I do, that your
engagement with Herriard will come to nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>More than a challenge now; it was a threat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot discuss that with you,&#8221; Alexia returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;If,&#8221; he said, with a cold deliberateness that was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
significant of a purpose, &#8220;you have any regard for
Geoffrey Herriard, you will best show it by accepting
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have had my answer,&#8221; she said, moving towards
the bell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Given in ignorance,&#8221; he retorted, &#8220;in wilful blindness
as to what the future may hold for you.&#8221; He
moved nearer to her, his face resolute and threatening.
&#8220;If Herriard is not already dead, he will never live to
be your husband.&#8221;</p>

<p>She gave an instant&#8217;s upward glance at the face,
whose expression of sinister power beat back the contempt
she tried to show in hers. Without a word she
put her hand to the bell. Before, however, she could
ring, the door opened, and the butler came in with a
telegram. Alexia took it, and turned as though to dismiss
Gastineau.</p>

<p>&#8220;You had better open it, Countess,&#8221; he said quietly,
&#8220;before I go. It probably confirms my news of Herriard.&#8221;</p>

<p>Alexia was in two minds; but in her desire above all
things not to show fear, she tore open the telegram.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, with a supreme effort to hide her
sickening terror, &#8220;it confirms what you have told me.
Good-night.&#8221;</p>

<small>THE FACE IN THE BOX</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BY the earliest train next morning Alexia and her
brother travelled down to Bradbury, and found
to their relief that Herriard&#8217;s condition was not nearly
so serious as they had feared. He was suffering from
a wound in the head and slight concussion caused by
the vicious blow that had been dealt him; but the doctor
made light of his hurt, and declared two or three days
would see him practically recovered.</p>

<p>This was grateful news to Alexia, who had dreaded
the worst; nevertheless the ugly, haunting fact remained
of a malignant purpose secretly at work against her
lover and herself. None of the local politicians could
account for what was admittedly an organized attack.
It had taken the whole town by surprise, not merely
by its unusual ferocity, but by the comparative absence
of adequate motive, and by the secrecy with which it
had been planned. But to Alexia it was no mystery.
She recognized well enough the determined, energetic
brain that had conceived and designed the murderous
affray, and she was well aware how thankful (if fear
could leave room for gladness) she might be that the
attack had failed to achieve its ulterior and especial
object. Gastineau&#8217;s words to her had made that plain
enough.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, so anxious was she not to retard or jeopardize
her lover&#8217;s recovery that until it was almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
complete she said nothing to him of Gastineau&#8217;s visit.
Then she told him everything, and the diabolical plot
became clear to them both. It was certain now that
the man Herriard had seen was Hencher; to him, doubtless,
had been left the final conduct of the attack; it
must, too, have been he who had sent off the late telegram
to Alexia. But the whole object and motive of
the affair were so clearly the outcome of Gastineau&#8217;s
design against Herriard, that it seemed scarcely worth
while to piece together the details of the scheme.</p>

<p>&#8220;Naturally, it is of the utmost importance for his
safety to put me out of the way,&#8221; Herriard said bitterly;
&#8220;quite apart from his desire to marry you. You
and I are the only two people in the world he has really
to fear; we know too much; in fact, everything. If
once I were dead, and you his wife, that fear would be
laid to rest, and he would be free to practise whatever
new scheme of life he may have decided upon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; suggested Alexia, restlessly eager, &#8220;let us
forestall him, and tell everything to the police. It is
our only chance. Are we to be at the mercy of this
devil incarnate?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who has none,&#8221; was the gloomy reply. &#8220;No,&#8221;
Herriard continued, with a shake of the head; &#8220;there
is no hope in that. I can only repeat that there is
nothing tangible against Gastineau; only a suspicion,
on which the authorities would hardly dare to arrest
him. His supposititious death is no offence at law.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, my dear Geoffrey, are you, then, to go forever
in fear of your life? Do these threats and attempts
constitute no offence?&#8221;</p>

<p>Herriard laughed hopelessly. &#8220;Who could prove
them? Do you think that calculating mind has not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
foreseen and provided against every possible contingency?
It would give a man of Gastineau&#8217;s resource
little trouble to loose himself from any knots with which
we might try to bind him. My story of his threats he
would probably laugh out of court.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But his attack upon you in your chambers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be uncorroborated. He would probably
swear that I attacked him; and our former relations
would give colour to the story he would concoct, while
they would tend to the discredit of my evidence. No,
dear one, I see no help or hope from an appeal to the law.
Just think how improbable, how incredible my story
would sound told in the dry atmosphere of a Law Court,
and impugned by the cleverest brain in the profession.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I fear you are right,&#8221; Alexia said dejectedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Even if I gained my point,&#8221; Herriard went on,
&#8220;it would not mean effective protection against him.
London is the best policed city in the world, but that
does not prevent a man&#8217;s life being absolutely at the
mercy of any other man&#8217;s determination to take it.
And Gastineau&#8217;s purpose is, we know, above everything
tenacious and relentless.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Geoffrey, my darling,&#8221; Alexia cried in her agitation,
&#8220;what are we to do? Is there no hope? I would
rather kill this fiend with my own hand than that he
should take you from me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has not taken me yet, and I mean to make a
fight for it,&#8221; Herriard assured her, assuming a confidence
he did not feel. He knew his enemy&#8217;s untiring
vindictiveness and resource too well.</p>

<p>For a long while they talked over chances and expedients
for escaping from the net, spun by that busy
brain, that seemed to have enmeshed them. The present<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
moment was theirs, with its mockery of freedom,
and it seemed monstrous to accept the future with
blank despair. In the end, after many a futile struggle
against the narrowing circle of bands that was drawn
round them, after many a suggestion rejected in its
very conception, a course was decided upon. It was
that they should be married at once, with the closest
secrecy that might hope to elude even Gastineau&#8217;s vigilance,
and that they should leave England, as already
planned, for a long sojourn on Count von Rohnburg&#8217;s
Austrian estate. Certainly it seemed but a poor method
of securing safety;&mdash;was there a corner on the globe
where a man might hope to hide from that inexorable,
unswerving pursuit?&mdash;still there was the chance, the
only one, of snatching a fearful, short-lived joy in defiance
of the incarnate malignity which forbade it.</p>

<p>Once decided upon, the details of the plan were soon
settled. A special license would be procured, and the
marriage would take place at a village church in
Gloucestershire, the vicar of which was an old friend
and schoolfellow of Herriard&#8217;s. Then, with all the
wariness and secrecy they could devise, they would set
off upon the long journey to Rohnburg, trusting to
chance for safety, and to the improbable event that
Gastineau might see fit to abandon his scheme of persecution
and pursuit. At least, they argued, the danger
would not be increased by the change of locality. He
might, indeed, be better able to deal with his enemy,
should he follow him, in that remote spot than in one of
the centres of civilization, where the rules of law and
order permit no drastic measures for obviating an unprovable
danger. Anyhow at Rohnburg they would be
man to man.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>A very few days saw Herriard quite recovered from
the hurt which had by good fortune just fallen short
of its sinister intent, and the plans for the hurried marriage
were carried through without a hitch. Both Alexia
and he felt that the peaceful village church in its picturesque
seclusion made the ceremony, which derived an
added solemnity from the threatening cloud of the unknown
which in the glorious sunshine grew darker by
contrast, fitting indeed to a union set in all the element
of romance. But that day of happiness and many
that followed were unmarred by any sign of the dreaded
fate that should be dogging them. Whether Gastineau
were near or far from them, they were troubled by no
suggestion of his presence or intentions; their world,
full of snatched delight, seemed free from that hateful
influence.</p>

<p>From the lovely rural nook Herriard and his bride
made their way across country to Harwich, thence to
the Continent; and reached Vienna, the penultimate
stage of their journey, without any disquieting incident.</p>

<p>With a confidence born of the continued immunity
from all indication of danger, they determined to stay
two days in the fascinating Austrian capital. On the
morning after their arrival Herriard happened to meet
Dr. Hallamar in the K&auml;rnthnerstrasse. An impulse
made him accost the great specialist, and speak of the
subject which dominated his mind. After a few words
of greeting, he said, &#8220;That was a wonderful cure of
yours, Doctor, in the case of Mr. Murray.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just a film of caution seemed to form over the professional
enthusiasm which illuminated the doctor&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes; in many ways the most remarkable of my
experience. Unfortunately&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he broke off, eyeing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
Herriard doubtfully. &#8220;A singular man, your friend
Mr. Murray,&#8221; he added, tentatively, it seemed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very,&#8221; Herriard agreed. &#8220;You refer to his wishing
to keep his cure a secret?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hallamar nodded, throwing out his hands expressively.
&#8220;Ach! There it is,&#8221; he exclaimed vehemently.
&#8220;The most extraordinary case of all I have treated.
The most&mdash;I say it without vanity; science is, as I follow
it, too serious, too stern in its reality to admit of that&mdash;the
most surprising cure, utterly unhoped-for; I can
tell you, Mr. Herriard, I undertook the case with great
reluctance. My time is precious; moreover I am not
fond of courting failure, and charging a necessarily high
fee for a foregone disappointment. But there was something
observable in your friend&#8217;s character and temperament
which induced me to undertake the experiment,
for it was nothing more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is a man of great determination.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Professor made a significant gesture. &#8220;Quite
abnormal. And it was in a great measure to that we
owe a cure which comes as near to a miracle as science
has yet attained. Ah! such strength of will, such fixity
of purpose, what would the world be if they were
general? A paradise in which all evils and difficulties
would be overcome&mdash;or a hell of restless intellect.
Well,&#8221; he gave a shrug and a smile, &#8220;we are better as
we are. Nevertheless your friend is a very remarkable
man: it is a personality with which I am pleased, as
an experience, to have been brought in contact.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can understand that,&#8221; Herriard said, with a shade
of gloom. &#8220;Then Murray was practically a sound man
again when I first mentioned him to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly he was,&#8221; Hallamar answered emphatically.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
&#8220;For what seemed, even to me, a really hopeless case,
it was an astonishingly quick recovery of power. He
was weeks ahead of my hitherto best patient. But then
I have never had a patient of his character. Yes; he
was cured when you first expressed a wish that I should
treat him. And I may say I was much surprised that
you, his intimate friend, should have been kept in the
dark.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He wished, no doubt, to give me an agreeable surprise,&#8221;
Herriard explained grimly. &#8220;As it was, I found
out his recovery by a mere accident.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ach, so!&#8221; Dr. Hallamar&#8217;s strong face wore a look
of sagacious curiosity. &#8220;It is strange. Yes; I remember
he sent me a note desiring me to say nothing about
his recovery to you. Ah, a man of singular strength
of mind; he was evidently preparing a surprise for his
friend. You are his great friend; not?&#8221;</p>

<p>The question was put so abruptly, so pointedly, that
Herriard was startled into looking up quickly into the
other&#8217;s face. He felt that Hallamar was trying to read
in his eyes the true state of his relationship with Gastineau;
and that the result was a confirmed doubt.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are scarcely,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;as friendly as we
were once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No?&#8221; Hallamar&#8217;s manner could not be said to
express even a polite regret. &#8220;Well, perhaps that may
be not altogether a bad thing,&#8221; he suggested. &#8220;Mr.
Murray is too clever for close friendship with most of
us. Such towering intellect as his stands better alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>With which significant, if equivocal, comment he gave
his hand to Herriard and hurried off.</p>

<p>It was on the evening before their departure from
Vienna that a strange experience befell them which, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
a time at least, brought back their fears. Herriard had
taken a box at the old Burg Theatre to see a famous
melodramatic piece that had won popularity all over
the Continent. At one part of the performance the
lights in the auditorium were lowered to enhance the
effect of a thrilling scene. Suddenly, as they sat in the
darkness, Alexia clutched Herriard&#8217;s arm. &#8220;Geoffrey!&#8221;
she exclaimed under her breath.</p>

<p>Under the impression that the blood-curdling business
on the stage had affected her, he gave her hand a
reassuring clasp, and whispered a few light words making
fun of the mimic horrors. But after that first start
Alexia had quickly recovered her self-possession. She
raised her fan till it half covered her face, while her
eyes were directed apprehensively across the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Geoffrey,&#8221; she whispered, coolly now, though with
an intensity of repressed fear, &#8220;don&#8217;t look yet. In that
box opposite, next the stage, a man is watching us.
Be careful.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the fear had returned. Herriard leaned back in
his chair with an affected yawn and looked at the box
Alexia had indicated. It was the only one on that side
of the house which seemed untenanted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can see no one in it,&#8221; he said in a low tone. &#8220;The
box seems empty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am certain,&#8221; she whispered back behind her fan,
&#8220;that there was a man in it just now. I saw a pair
of hateful eyes watching us out of the darkness. They
have disappeared now; but I am sure of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gastineau?&#8221; Herriard dreaded to ask the question,
yet knew there was no safety in ignoring the worst,
if such it were.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot be certain,&#8221; Alexia answered, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
tremor of her tone seemed to belie the doubt she expressed.
&#8220;Is there another man on earth with eyes
like his?&#8221;</p>

<p>Herriard tried to laugh reassuringly. &#8220;Surely that
is not inconceivable,&#8221; he returned, &#8220;especially in this
cosmopolitan city. You say the man was watching us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Herriard strained his look to detect a sign of movement
in the obscurity of the apparently empty box.
But nothing broke the dead blackness of the recess.
&#8220;I will go and make certain,&#8221; he said, rising.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, Geoffrey,&#8221; she objected apprehensively,
&#8220;stay here; you must not go. There may be danger.&#8221;
And as she looked up at him, he could see, even through
the darkness, the fear in her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is all right, darling,&#8221; he replied, with perhaps
more confidence than he felt. &#8220;I have my revolver;
there can be no danger. Uncertainty is the worst now
we have to fear, and I must put an end to that.&#8221; So,
with a reassuring caress, he left her.</p>

<p>Traversing the now dimly lighted semi-circular corridor
Herriard made his way round the house till he
came to the box he sought. Somewhat to his surprise,
the door stood ajar. He opened it, and looked in. The
box was empty.</p>

<p>Having convinced himself of this, Herriard asked the
name of the gentleman who had occupied the box. He
was told that through a misunderstanding that particular
box had not been let, although the house was
otherwise full. When he insisted that it had been lately
occupied, he was told that he must be mistaken, or
perhaps one of the attendants had gone into it for a
few minutes to watch the great scene. Anyhow the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
officials were certain that the box had not been let or
regularly occupied that evening.</p>

<p>Considerably relieved, Herriard went back to Alexia.
As he reached her the curtain fell, and the lights were
turned up again. &#8220;It was your fancy, dear one,&#8221; he
said, in answer to her apprehensive look. &#8220;No one was
in that box. I searched it thoroughly and am certain
it was empty; besides, they tell me it was not let to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was troubled to see that she was not reassured.
&#8220;There was some one in it,&#8221; she asserted in a tone of
conviction. &#8220;Directly you had left me the door of that
box opened, and a man passed out. I am sure of that.
I distinctly saw the light from the passage beyond, and
the man&#8217;s figure against it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is quite likely,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;The official whom
I spoke to suggested that one of the attendants went
into the empty box to watch the scene. That is the
real explanation; but we, having Gastineau on the
nerves, are liable to see him anywhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was plain to him that Alexia could not bring herself
to accept the explanation, plausible as it was. The
enjoyment of the evening was gone; they soon after
left the theatre and returned to their hotel.</p>

<p>Neither on that night, however, nor on the next day,
which was passed in completing their long journey, did
they, although keenly alert, see anything to confirm
their uneasiness. Gastineau, if it had indeed been he,
was a man easily recognized, but their watchfulness
saw no one resembling him. As the hours wore on,
shortening the distance between her and the home she
loved, Alexia&#8217;s spirits rose, and she almost succeeded
in persuading herself that the terror of the night before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
had been but a creature of her nervous fancy. And so
it was in a happier state of mind that they caught their
first glimpse of the great Schloss Rohnburg, standing
in romantic picturesqueness amid its setting of pine
woods; and at the sight of the noble old house, welcoming
them in all its peaceful strength and beauty, they
forgot their fears in the sense of security it suggested.
Here was an asylum indeed; a delightful refuge from
the intrigues and dangers of the outside world. They
drove into the courtyard with a grateful sense of relief,
and a feeling that they had outstripped their Nemesis
and left danger far behind them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The days that followed confirmed this idea, that the
security for which they had scarcely dared to hope
had been attained. The estate of Rohnburg seemed
a compact miniature kingdom, in which Herriard and
his bride were for the time all-powerful, and from which
their authority would serve to keep any threatening
intruder away. Somehow Herriard felt, as he explored
the place, that the unwelcome appearance even of Gastineau
in that spot would lose much of the terror which
would be inspired by the idea of his tracking them with
a sleuth-hound&#8217;s tenacity amid the labyrinth of a populous
city. To meet an enemy in the open should have
no terrors for a man of courage, since the elements of
surprise and mystery, which beget fear, are absent. So
Herriard found, as the days passed, that the haunting
sense of an impending blow coming from a quarter of
which he was uncertain began to diminish. In an atmosphere
of security, freedom, happiness, his spirits rose,
carrying Alexia&#8217;s with them. They walked together in
the park which girded the Schloss, strolling along woodland<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
paths, and every succeeding day they went farther
afield. At first their walks were attended by a furtive
watchfulness against the appearance of a dreaded form,
for a hint of a sinister presence. Nothing, however, occurred
to fulfil their expectation, and, by degrees, the
strain of alertness was relaxed. And, while it lasted,
they neither of them cared to let the other know how
seriously their minds were haunted by the ever-present
misgiving. For a brave mind hates the fear that is
forced upon it too greatly to care to speak of it where
the telling can avail nothing. And, assuredly, the more
reason we have for keeping a bold face, the better too
it is for the beating down of a dread which is nothing
more than an invitation to our danger.</p>

<p>However, the long days as they went by brought
with them nothing but the delight of lovers&#8217; existence,
without sign of a disturbing element. Their heaven
was without a cloud and they began to reproach themselves
with having failed to enjoy its glory through
vain fears of a tempest. So, as the time slipped by,
the startling events they had passed through seemed
nothing more than the recollection of a troubled dream,
now fading in the light and joyousness of day. The
venerable stronghold which was, for many a month now,
to be their home, imparted to their hearts its sense of
calm security. It was fairy-land they had reached at
last; the gloom of the demon&#8217;s night had been left far
behind.</p>

<p>Yet on the bright sky of confident happiness a little
fleck was soon to appear, the precursor of cloud and
danger.</p>

<small>A PORTENT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ONE evening the monotony of the Herriard&#8217;s delightful
existence under the shadow of the grey
old Schloss was broken by the appearance of a company
of poor strolling players. They were, it appeared, a
band of humble comedians and pantomimists who, in
the more rural and remote districts, went from village
to village, to gain a precarious livelihood by giving a
crude medley of melodrama and farce, interspersed with
singing and acrobatic feats. To gain permission for a
short performance at a great house naturally was, when
such an opportunity presented itself, much to be desired.
It meant probably less work for a greater reward,
compared with the two or three hours&#8217; toil, required
to conjure kreutzers from the thrifty peasants&#8217; pockets.
Alexia knew this, and persuaded her husband to join
with her in sanctioning the humble show. Herriard had
at first shown himself a little dubious as to the wisdom
of inviting strangers within the precincts of the castle.
But Alexia quickly laughed away his doubts; these
strolling mummers were familiar visitors. They had
made their appearance there at more or less regular intervals
ever since she could remember; she would like
to hear their bombastic nonsense and the old songs once
again for the sake of old times, and she called Gollmar,
the ancient steward, to bear witness that there was no
harm in the poor fellows.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>So it came that Herriard readily fell in with Alexia&#8217;s
wish; he ordered the troupe to be admitted to the inner
courtyard, and for an hour they laughed together at the
strange, half-incomprehensible performance of the strollers.</p>

<p>Certainly they were, for the most part, a strange,
weird, almost forbidding dozen of human beings; but
then in stage-struck peasants from the wild regions of
Austro-Hungary one would scarcely expect to find the
graces of players drawn from more civilized surroundings.
When the performance was over, Herriard sent
them a liberal fee, and they were given a substantial
meal under the superintendence of Gollmar, who was
directed to keep his eye upon them until they were once
more outside the gates.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was, perhaps, as well, <i>gn&auml;diger Herr</i>,&#8221; the old
man observed afterwards, &#8220;to keep the fellows under
observation. Our countrymen have a saying, &#8216;One
coat suffices to keep warm a player and a thief.&#8217; Not
but what these scoundrels are good honest mountebanks
for their sort; still, there was no harm in keeping
them from the temptation to pilfer. Old Karonsek,
the leader, I have known for well-nigh forty years: he
has, naturally, a reputation to preserve, since he boasts
he has never seen the inside of a prison; but the younger
men&mdash;&#8221; he gave a shrug, &#8220;what would you have? A
man does not often turn player till every respectable
calling is closed to him, and our proverb says a man
who has no home has no neighbours to call him thief
when he steals. But,&#8221; he added, by way of softening
his strictures upon the average morality of theatrical
strollers, &#8220;your honour&#8217;s kindness has given untold
pleasure to the household. Few amusements come our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
way in this remote spot, and in the late Count&#8217;s time
we always made the humblest strollers welcome.&#8221;</p>

<p>Two nights later Herriard was roused from his sleep
by the furious barking of a dog, followed by a man&#8217;s
angry cry. Snatching up his revolver, he ran downstairs,
and, guided by the sounds, rushed into the library.
The moonlight, streaming in through the half-open
window, showed him one of the men servants, Jan
Martin, leaning over a writing table, his hand held to
his chest, while he was almost inarticulate with rage
and fear. As Herriard&#8217;s approach he pointed excitedly
to the window. &#8220;There! He has gone that way. A
robber, Excellency: the wretch has stabbed me. Quick!
he cannot be far away. Fritz has gone after him.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a word to the wounded man, Herriard passed
out by the window. He could hear Fritz, the wolf-hound,
still barking savagely, but now there came from
him a howl of pain, and then all was silent. He hurried
forward, and about a hundred yards away came upon
the poor animal bleeding, and quite disabled. No sign
of the midnight robber was to be seen, although Herriard
ran in pursuit of him. But the plantation at which
he had arrived was large, its paths devious; unless he
came upon him by chance it was almost hopeless to
expect to overtake the man. Herriard stopped and
listened. Not a sound was to be heard except presently
that of running footsteps of men from the castle
who, headed by Gollmar, were coming in pursuit. But
half-an-hour&#8217;s energetic search by the party brought no
result; the miscreant, whoever he was, had made good
his escape.</p>

<p>As Herriard took his way back to the castle his apprehensions,
which had been lulled, returned in full<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
strength. In the courtyard the poor dog, Fritz, lay
moaning in pain. Herriard examined his hurt, which
he found to be a punctured wound just below the throat.
On the ground beside him lay an object which Herriard
eagerly picked up and scrutinized. It was a small piece
of coarse cloth, evidently torn by the dog from the intruder&#8217;s
coat. He showed it to Gollmar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said the old steward, looking critically at the
fragment, &#8220;it is as I suspected. Certainly one of the
play-actor fellows who were here on Tuesday. I noticed
one or two knavish faces among the new members
of the troupe. He has been tempted to earn a year&#8217;s
pay in a single night. A daring, beggarly villain. His
after-thought is likely to mean death to Jan Martin, if
not to poor Fritz as well. Well, if Fritz dies there will
be a reckoning to pay with the Count.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think, then, it was one of those wretched fellows,
the players?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure of it, <i>gn&auml;diger Herr</i>. Look at this scrap
of cloth. It is of the coarsest description. Such as
would be worn only by a peasant or a strolling mountebank.
And no peasant, in his mind or out of it, would
dare to plan a midnight robbery, with murder if need
be, at the Schloss Rohnburg. It is out of the question.
No; this evidence points to one of those ranting tatterdemalions,
who have the wits of a drunkard and the
reverence of a pig.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gollmar&#8217;s manifest conviction of the man&#8217;s identity
somewhat reassured Herriard, and he was able to relate
the affair to Alexia without communicating to her the
fears he had at first entertained. The doctor who had
been sent for reported Jan Martin&#8217;s wound as not dangerous;
with a week&#8217;s quiet he would recover from its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
effects. Fritz, too, had had a wonderful escape; the
evidently hasty stab he had received having just missed
being mortal.</p>

<p>Still, although, providentially, not much harm had
been done, the affair gave Herriard considerable uneasiness.
He made light of it, since there seemed no object
to be gained by taking it, outwardly at least, more
seriously. Yet, somehow, it contrived to give him an
ever-present conviction of impending danger. When
he reasoned the matter out with himself he was bound
to admit that the common-sense arguments pointed to
the confirmation of Gollmar&#8217;s simple theory. What
more likely, he asked himself, than that a member of
a lawless, homeless, strolling party of mountebanks,
recruited probably from the dregs of society, if not,
indeed, from the jails, should use the opportunity of
admittance to a house of wealth to plan an attempt
which promised a tempting haul? Had Herriard&#8217;s mind,
as he admitted, not been full of Gastineau and his
methods, he would not have thought to question the
obvious explanation. As it was, the affair, unpleasant
enough in itself, gave a disagreeable shock, the effects
of which did not leave him when he found that the
harm done by the midnight marauder was far less than
it might have been.</p>

<p>But the days went by, resuming their uneventful
course. A week passed, and at its end both man and
dog had quite recovered from their wounds. Herriard
began to think that it had, after all, been a case of
attempted robbery by one of the strolling prayers.
Enquiries in the district had quite failed to identify
the scrap of cloth, and the idea that the culprit belonged
to the neighbourhood was scouted by every one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
in the place. A watch was now kept every night in
the castle, but no sign was detected of a renewal of the
attempt. Naturally, they said, the players were now
far away. On the night in question they had been
performing at a village but a few miles from Rohnburg.</p>

<p>So Herriard&#8217;s uneasiness, having nothing new to feed
upon, gradually subsided, and he gave himself up once
more to all the charm of existence which that romantic
domain afforded him.</p>

<p>One day it was announced to him that Fritz, the
wolf-hound, had mysteriously disappeared. He had
been always a domesticated animal, content for the
most part to lie basking in the sun on the terrace or in
the courtyard, and had never been known to stray far
from the castle. But now he had not been seen for
twenty-four hours, and every one was at a loss to account
for his absence. His wound was quite healed,
and he had seemed in perfect health, although one of
the men had noticed that he was unusually restless.
Herriard was at first inclined to be somewhat perturbed
by the occurrence, till one of the foresters, having a
peculiar knowledge of animals, adduced a theory which
tended to set his mind at rest. The dog&#8217;s behaviour,
he declared, was perfectly explicable. In his natural
state he would be a fierce, marauding, dangerous animal.
His real character had been tamed and held in
suspension by the luxury and kindness of a domestic
life. Now the hurt he had received had roused the animal&#8217;s
fiercer nature which had but slumbered. That
this was the case had been indicated by the dog&#8217;s noticeable
restlessness; he had now assuredly gone off on
a wild hunting prowl; the taste of live blood (he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
doubtless bitten the robber) had quickened his instinct,
and induced a craving for living prey.</p>

<p>With this explanation Herriard had to be satisfied.
He ordered, however, a thorough search to be made for
the dog, and it was with a certain sense of relief that
he heard this was unsuccessful; he had feared the finding
of the animal dead by that mysterious hand which
his fancy would picture as stretched forth against him
and his.</p>

<p>But Alexia laughed him out of his fear of the unknown.
Was not the world smiling on them with all the delights
of an ideal existence? What sign was there, save
in imagination, of the danger they had dreaded? It
was a sin to let the memory of a trouble, now past and
gone, destroy the delight of the present hour. Paul
Gastineau was not a fool to waste, in pursuing them
with his hatred, time which might be spent to more
advantage in opening out his new career. Probably he
had for once spoken the frank truth, and was by that
time across the ocean, eager to put into practice the
fresh schemes and projects of his busy, ambitious brain.
In the weeks they had spent at the Schloss Rohnburg
what tangible sign had there been of the presence or
machinations of their arch enemy? None. If he had
meant to strike, why this delay? He was, above all
things, a man of swift action. No. Geoffrey should
not worry himself any more with those fancies. The
danger was now a myth, opposed by common sense;
if it were real, the worry would not keep it away. So
Herriard resolved to be guided by Alexia&#8217;s counsel, and
to give himself up thenceforward to the full enjoyment
of the new life he had entered upon. After the
stuffy turmoil of the Courts it was indeed a change<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
full of delight, a life never even dreamt of a month
before.</p>

<p>There was plenty of sport to be had in the forest
which stretched away from the Schloss, and Herriard,
with the enjoyment of one for whom struggle and danger
had suddenly ceased, threw himself with zest into
the novel, emancipated life, and wandered every day
farther in pursuit of game. In the still depths of the
forest, in a fairy-land which seemed far from the ken
of worldly strife and schemes, Herriard felt he had left
the events of a few weeks back years behind him; he
could laugh at his fears. Paul Gastineau was no longer
a haunting terror, but merely a strange episode.</p>

<p>What creatures of our impressions, our surroundings
we are. How one mind, determined, inscrutable, can
dominate a weaker: how long the paralyzing effect of
a stronger will lingers, to be weakened and at last banished
not by a human effort but by the external agency
of a changed environment.</p>

<p>Reflections such as these were passing through Herriard&#8217;s
mind as, after a full day&#8217;s sport, he sat, tranquilly
smoking a cigar, on the platform of an ancient
hunting-tower which stood in the forest depths some
two or three miles from the castle. The two foresters
who had accompanied him he had sent home with the
heavy bag of game; being himself somewhat tired with
his long tramp, he had thought to rest awhile before
resuming his homeward walk.</p>

<p>The tower was situated in an open clearing where
three glades met. To Herriard, as he stretched himself
comfortably on the old weather-beaten benches,
it seemed the most tranquilly romantic spot in the
world. All round him from the sunlit dell rose majestically<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span>
the dark violet masses of the vast forest; its
density pierced by the three moss-carpeted roads which
the tower commanded. The day had been hot; a hazy
film seemed to hang over the dark, illimitable battalions
of pines, standing motionless in the windless atmosphere.
On either side of the long vista which lay
before Herriard&#8217;s idle observation, the haze seemed to
line the dark walls, fringing the avenue beyond the line
of trees, and leaving a narrow road still bright and clear.</p>

<p>Presently Herriard became conscious that far down
this glade, perhaps half an English mile away, a figure
had appeared. For a while he watched it lazily, as a
break in that magnificent monotony it had become the
most interesting object in sight, and it amused the
watcher to observe whether the figure was moving towards
the tower or away from it. Nearer, surely; but
with a progress so slow as to be scarcely perceptible.
Herriard took out his stalking glasses and brought them
to bear on the object of his curiosity. A man, a bent
old man, he seemed, carrying a load, probably a faggot-gatherer
crawling on his daily round. Herriard put
back the glasses&mdash;he was never quite free now from
suspicion&mdash;and contentedly resumed his cigar. Then
he fell to moralizing, as an idle man will, over the lot
of such an one as the solitary peasant who was creeping
slowly towards him. Presently as he looked, the
figure bore to one side of the track, and next moment
vanished in the curtain of mist that hung before the
line of trees. He had crept off by some forest path,
Herriard conjectured, with a slight feeling of an ended
companionship. For in that place, surrounded by the
almost oppressive loneliness compelled by nature in all
her unchallenged predominance and autocracy, even the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>
distant presence of an obscure peasant creeping laboriously
through the forest ways to his primitive hovel,
gave a welcome touch of company. But he was gone
now, passed out of his observer&#8217;s life, in all probability
never to cross his way again.</p>

<p>With that thought in his mind Herriard gave an exclamation
of surprise. There again was the man he
had seen and who was still furnishing a text for his
moralizing; he had reappeared as abruptly as he had
vanished. He was close at hand now, almost under the
tower; the same bent figure, bowed beneath a bundle
of faggots, and using one as a staff to aid his steps.</p>

<p>The old man seemed to have come quickly from the
point where he had disappeared not many minutes before;
if, perhaps, more time had not passed in the interval
than Herriard was conscious of. The man came
on until he was under the tower, and so out of sight
from the platform. Herriard was debating with himself
whether he should accost the solitary creature and
brighten the day for him with a present of a few florins,
when, somewhat to his surprise, he heard the slow footsteps
ascending the winding stairs of the tower. Perhaps,
he thought, the old fellow is accustomed to billet
himself here; the half-ruinous building is useless
enough; one could scarcely complain.</p>

<p>At the floor below the footsteps stopped for a while:
if the poor man was resting there comfortably Herriard
would not disturb him unnecessarily. No; he was moving
about softly; now, surely he was on the stairs again,
coming up to the roof platform. It seemed a strange
thing to do; the reason was not quite obvious, unless
the man had noticed a stranger there, and was coming
up to beg. Herriard watched for his appearance with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[307]</span>
some curiosity. The ascent sounded hard and laboured,
and when at length the expected figure emerged from
the trap-door the man&#8217;s back was, by the trend of the
steps, turned towards the place where Herriard sat.
For a few moments he seemed to fumble with his neck-cloth,
apparently unaware that he was not alone, since
he took no notice of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;What in the world is he doing?&#8221; As the remark
was uttered half aloud, the man turned quickly. The
unkempt beard was gone; and, with a great leap of the
heart, Herriard found himself staring at the face of
Paul Gastineau.</p>

<small>THE LAST MEETING</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IF Herriard had had for the moment any doubts as
to Gastineau&#8217;s identity, the sneering smile, quiet
and purposeful, would have set them at rest.</p>

<p>&#8220;At last, Mr. Geoffrey Herriard, we meet again; and
finally,&#8221; the cold, incisive voice said; and Herriard knew
that the crisis of his fate, possibly his last minute of
life, had come. For as he spoke Gastineau drew his
hand from the pocket of his ragged peasant&#8217;s coat, and
the polished barrel of a revolver glinted in the sweep
of sunlight that poured up the glade and struck the
tower. The action was characteristic of the man, business-like,
yet no more than just necessarily demonstrative.
But it contained a significant suggestion that
resistance was futile; it said plainly, no quarter.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry,&#8221; Gastineau proceeded, as coolly as
though he had come to discuss a professional matter,
&#8220;to be obliged to interrupt your repose; but you will
understand that when a man is more or less fighting
for his life he cannot afford to be punctilious. I think,
Herriard, you have a revolver in your pocket. Covered
as you are by mine, its use is not apparent. Do me
the favour to take it out and throw it over the parapet.
It will obviate any preoccupation in our talk.&#8221;</p>

<p>He came to within a few feet of Herriard with his
own revolver covering the other&#8217;s heart. Herriard, realizing
his helplessness, took out his weapon and threw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span>
it over the embrasured wall. It fell noiselessly on the
soft turf below.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want with me, Gastineau?&#8221; he said, in
the dull voice of a man who sees no escape from his fate.</p>

<p>Gastineau drew back a few steps, and seated himself
on the low parapet that protected the stairway. &#8220;A
little conversation first of all,&#8221; he answered; banteringly
it would have been but for the suggestion of a
dark purpose behind the easy manner; &#8220;a few minutes&#8217;
talk, and then&#8221;&mdash;he made a deprecating gesture&mdash;&#8220;silence.&#8221;</p>

<p>The word was ominous and struck chill to Herriard&#8217;s
heart. He had busied his mind in looking for a way
of escape, but none presented itself. In the sickening
sense of despair he could thank Heaven for the short-lived
joy and love that had been his.</p>

<p>There was nothing he could say to any purpose: he
felt that, and waited for Gastineau to continue.</p>

<p>&#8220;I dare say you were weak enough to imagine you
had given me the slip,&#8221; the chilling, hateful voice resumed.
&#8220;Certainly it is a far cry from Mayfair to the
Schloss Rohnburg, but then the necessity of self-preservation
cannot stop to take heed of time and space.
It may astonish you that I have seen proper to take
so much trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>Looking at the evil, resolute face, Herriard could only
wonder how he could have been fool enough to imagine
that his enemy had abandoned the set purpose of his
vindictiveness and self-interest to which every fibre of
his proved character surely held him. The affair of
the nocturnal intruder was no mystery now, if ever
doubt on the matter should have been allowed to dwell
with his knowledge of this man.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span>&#8220;You talk of self-preservation,&#8221; he said, with a
dulled effort at reasoning, for the word seemed to mock
him; &#8220;as though you were convinced I had some
design against you. I have none; you might know
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gastineau&#8217;s laugh showed him that the protest carried
no weight with him. &#8220;My good fellow,&#8221; he returned
patronizingly, &#8220;you scarcely comprehend my position.
It is, perhaps, a trifle beyond your grasp. Putting aside
for the moment the fact that you have done me the
ill-turn which no man forgives, and which was in your
case, I suppose, as glaring an instance of ingratitude as
any on record, let me put the situation before you from
my point of view.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; let me hear it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Herriard felt his only chance lay in prolonging the
preliminaries of the act that was surely meditated.</p>

<p>Gastineau was lighting a cigarette. &#8220;The immense
successes the world has wondered at have been gained
through foresight,&#8221; he said, almost meditatively; &#8220;the
great failures have been courted by want of it. The
man who cannot see beyond his nose, who takes things
as they are, and not as they will be, can never have a
great career in front of him. Consequently, my good
Herriard,&#8221; he blew out a long streak of smoke, &#8220;I am
obliged, unpleasant as it may be, to deal with you not
as you are to-day, a comparatively harmless turtle-dove,
but as my prescience tells me you will be in the future,
an active, threatening danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was death, Herriard saw, in the eyes that had
marked, in the mind that had tracked him down; no
suggestion of relenting, no room for pity, only the steely
look of doom.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span>&#8220;No; never now a danger to you, Gastineau,&#8221; he
said with dry lips.</p>

<p>The other smiled. &#8220;I can read your future better
than you,&#8221; he returned equivocally. &#8220;And your character.
My four years&#8217; study of that has scarcely gone
for nothing. You are, perhaps, not exactly, an absorbing
danger at the present moment, in the present year,
if you like. I would not care to say as much with respect
to a few years hence.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man was clearly, grimly settled in his purpose;
it was with him manifestly an affair of calculation rather
than of passion. Despite the deep purple glory of the
flaming sunset, the night seemed already enveloping
Herriard, as he stood there facing his doom. To him
the warm, scented air was chill and heavy; the gorgeous
flood of sunlight that bathed the tower was lurid and
murky as a torch of the Inquisition. But he kept down
the betrayal of the sickening despair at his heart, answering
his master quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you really read my character, Gastineau, you
must know that it is far from being restless and aggressive
like your own. With me it is live and let live.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; Gastineau&#8217;s lips were contorted sarcastically.
&#8220;A very apt motto at the present juncture.
Nevertheless, one requires something more convincing
than a trite copy-book text to persuade one of the desirability
of living the rest of one&#8217;s life under a sword
of Damocles. You know the fable of the wise fool who
neglected to keep his pet lion cub&#8217;s claws pared. History,
my good fellow, is full of such crass omissions
and their consequences. So far as I am concerned, history
shall not repeat itself.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was hateful, sneering determination in the man&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[312]</span>
face as he spoke. Herriard knew well that he never
relented, and wondered why his enemy did not make
an end of the business without more parley. Gastineau&#8217;s
hand, grasping the revolver, was kept well in
front of him, the wrist forming a pivot on his crossed
knee. A struggle was clearly out of the question; the
alert eyes never left him, for all their owner&#8217;s mannered
nonchalance. A sudden spring would mean a bullet
through the heart before it came to a grapple.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can only repeat, Gastineau, that you can have
nothing to fear from me.&#8221; Herriard spoke mechanically;
the suspense was numbing his mind; suspense
that was a mere question of time, not deliverance.</p>

<p>Gastineau smiled. &#8220;If I am far from believing it, it
does not follow that I doubt your sincerity in making
the declaration. Only, as I have said, fortunately or
unfortunately, I know more of the world in general and
of Mr. Geoffrey Herriard in particular than does that
person himself. No, my dear fellow,&#8221;&mdash;there was a
revolting irony in the term&mdash;&#8220;when I am a great man,
a very great man, as, bar accidents, I mean to be, it
would be a quite irresistible temptation to one like yourself
to shake the ladder just as I had reached the topmost
rung. Don&#8217;t protest; I know human nature. The
temptation would be overpowering&mdash;I don&#8217;t mean to
blackmail; I put you above that&mdash;but to stand, virtuously,
public-spiritedly, of course, in my way. And
it might not be as easy to put you to silence on that day
as it is now. A man is a fool who starts to climb the
highest ladder, leaving at the foot a fellow who has the
power, and, maybe, the inclination, to twist it over.&#8221;</p>

<p>Herriard kept wondering why he did not make an
end of his talk.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span>&#8220;So you know, or think you know,&#8221; Gastineau went
on coolly, &#8220;that Martindale owed his death to me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know nothing,&#8221; Herriard protested, with the
vision of Alexia before his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have at least a strong suspicion, which is sufficient
for my purpose. A suspicion shared by that
astute and able officer, Detective Inspector Quickjohn.
Ah! I am sorry for you both, but you will recognize
that it would be sheer folly on my part to enter the
race handicapped by the extra and unnecessary weight
of a suspicion of murder.&#8221;</p>

<p>His tone was so blandly reflective that Herriard regarded
him in surprise; half wondering whether he was
in his right senses. Nothing but the dangling revolver
suggested a dread intent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gastineau,&#8221; he said, steadying his voice, dry and
strange from the desperate fear that was in him, &#8220;you
are hideously wrong in thinking me likely to communicate
my suspicions to any living creature. And you
must be out of your mind to imagine that taking my
life, if that is your meaning, will clear the way to the
goal you aim at. Do you, clever man that you are,
suppose that you can kill me with impunity? That my
murder will not turn suspicion into a certainty leading
to the gallows.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gastineau listened with an indulgent smile. &#8220;I imagine
nothing of the kind, my good Herriard,&#8221; he returned.
&#8220;In the first place I am not exactly going to
kill you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. You are going within the next few minutes
to take your own life, being burdened by the idea of
a false position, at a moment when I shall be able to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span>
prove if necessary that Paul Gastineau was many hundred
miles away.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was murder in the face now, and Herriard set
his own as he saw it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You think so?&#8221;</p>

<p>With the recklessness of desperation, now that the
passing hope had vanished, he could almost chaff the
man who announced his doom.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have a mighty confidence in yourself as a layer
of plans, but you have overlooked one circumstance
which will surely bring you to the scaffold.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed? What is that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am in the habit of thinking, as you should be
aware. And know that I have overlooked nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean to murder the Countess Alexia as
well?&#8221; Herriard&#8217;s voice half broke as he pronounced
the name, and he knew that his enemy noticed it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Scarcely,&#8221; Gastineau answered, with his air of superior
wisdom. &#8220;If you call the circumstance of her
being alive a danger, it is one that I mean to turn into
a means of safety. You were good enough just now to
tell me to think. Let deep thought in turn point out
to shallow surmise that the very factor you have alluded
to in the case is in reality one which makes your death
imperative. If one may take your look for one of incredulity,
I will explain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you please.&#8221; Was there no chance? Herriard
was searching desperately for one as he spoke mechanically,
his life passing before him in a swift panorama
while he temporized with the inevitable.</p>

<p>Gastineau proceeded, speaking as casually as though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span>
he were telling a story in a club smoking-room. &#8220;The
only person, besides myself, who knows the real truth
of the <i>affaire</i> Martindale is the Countess Alexia. She
knows it because, as you may be aware, I have told
her what happened. Apart from shrewd suspicion and
fairy tales, conjectures, which, as we know, go for nothing
in the Law Courts, what the Countess knows is the
only tangible piece of evidence which could condemn
me for, say, manslaughter. There are two ways of securing
myself against the appearance of the Countess
in the box against me; the more agreeable of the two
is to marry her. But that is at the moment impossible
owing to a slight obstacle, the fact that the lady is, I
believe, at present your wife. Now, perhaps you begin
to take in the situation?&#8221;</p>

<p>Herriard&#8217;s brain was busy with futile searching for
a way out of it. He at least took in his adversary&#8217;s
fixity of purpose. He nodded gloomily in reply. Argument
was now clearly out of the question. The resolve
of a man who glories aggressively in his intellect
is merely clenched by opposition.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, apart from the Countess&#8217;s widowhood being
a <i>sine qu&acirc; non</i>,&#8221; Gastineau continued, in the same cold,
level tone, &#8220;there is the account of our rivalship to be
settled. That has been held throughout the ages to be
a more than sufficient reason for bloodshed, for a fight
<i>&acirc; outrance</i>. There has never been room in the world,
even when it was less crowded, for two lovers of the
same lady. The angle of love is now acute, now obtuse;
it is never a triangle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It has,&#8221; Herriard retorted, &#8220;always been the world&#8217;s
code in such cases for rivals to meet and settle the matter
on fair and equal terms.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>Gastineau smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not always, by any means, my dear Herriard.
Your history is at fault. In fact it has almost invariably
and proverbially been the custom for a rival to
take any advantage that chance might offer him. Duels
on so-called equal terms, for there really never was such
a thing, have been resorted to only where other means
of elimination were not practicable, or where one of
the parties was smart and skilful, the other a chivalrous,
incompetent fool. I don&#8217;t take my history from
the story-books.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The fool,&#8221; Herriard urged hopelessly, &#8220;had at least
a chance, if a poor one. He was not butchered in cold
blood.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gastineau shrugged.</p>

<p>&#8220;The fool had the satisfaction of dying with a weapon
in his hand, against which advantage must be set the
fact that he left behind him the reputation of not knowing
how to use it. But, my good fellow, when you talk
of advantage, surely you, who, when I was crippled,
had such a pull over me, are not going to complain now
that the tables are turned and the balance properly adjusted
in the proportion of our respective intellects.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If,&#8221; Herriard returned, touched to justify himself,
&#8220;I took advantage of your condition, it was, as you
know, unwittingly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I grant you that,&#8221; Gastineau assented readily.
&#8220;But when the position was readjusted&mdash;for I would
not have played the dog-in-the-manger&mdash;and your mistake
was pointed out, you refused to correct it. You
cannot deny you were warned; but it was to no purpose.
It were idle to argue that the lady prefers you;
that is merely an additional reason for your removal.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>He rose with an action as though to throw the end
of his cigarette over the parapet, but checked it cunningly,
to drop the stub of tobacco on the floor, and
stamp it to atoms. Herriard understood the astuteness
that meant to leave no incriminating evidence of its
presence. Then Gastineau, with a passing scrutiny of
the revolver, raised his eyes to Herriard&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Time is up,&#8221; he said incisively, with an ominous
squaring of the jaw. &#8220;I have given you, as between
man and man&mdash;I was going to say, old friends&mdash;my
reasons, more sufficient, perhaps, than agreeable. After
all, under the veneer of civilization, the rough, barbaric
sense of self-preservation is to-day as firmly existent as
ever. You have played a risky game, Herriard, and
have lost it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused, looking at Herriard as though he expected
him to make some reply. For a few moments the two
men stood gazing into each other&#8217;s eyes; and there was
death in both. The sun had sunk below the level of
the massed pine-trees, and now flooded the long avenue
with blood-red light. To Herriard, in that supreme
moment, in the exaltation of his senses, the sounds of
the forest came with abnormal distinctness. The whole
affair seemed a dream, even to his, its victim&#8217;s, tantalizing
helplessness. Gastineau, with all his set malignity
of purpose indexed in his hateful face, seemed unreal.
Herriard made a desperate effort to tell himself of his
danger, of his mad folly in submitting tamely to his
death like a decrepit hound. At least it was better to
die in an attacking rush than passively standing still.
He would accept his fate no more than its justice.</p>

<p>As he gathered his nerves for a spring which he knew
must be into eternity, since the deadly barrel covered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span>
him steadily, pitilessly, he was surprised, so far as anything
could touch him then, to see Gastineau turn half
away with a curiously apprehensive change of countenance.
Now or never was his chance. He gave a
great leap forward to throw himself upon his enemy.
Gastineau, turning quickly from what had drawn off
his attention, sprang aside with a devilish gleam of
combat in his eyes, and raised the revolver. He fired;
but Herriard, at close quarters now, had clutched his
arm, and the bullet went wide. Next moment, with a
sharp jerk, Gastineau had torn himself free from the
grasp, and, with a great backward spring, reached a
practicable firing distance. As the revolver was swiftly
brought down to the aim, and Herriard was madly throwing
himself upon his death, there came, though neither
of the men more than vaguely noticed it, a sound as of
a leaping rush; then the angry, attacking snarl of a dog;
and next instant Gastineau was flung staggering against
the parapet, with the wolf-hound, Fritz&#8217;s fangs gripping
his throat. Then, in a moment, he rallied from the
shock and surprise, and, bringing the muzzle of his revolver
to the dog&#8217;s breast, he fired. With a savage howl
and a convulsive effort the animal, who had for the instant
relaxed his hold, darted his head forward in a
renewed attack. With his left hand trying to thrust
back the dog, and his face working with rage and pain,
Gastineau raised the revolver to cover Herriard who was
trying for an opening to seize his enemy. As he did so,
the half-ruinous masonry of the parapet, against which
man and dog were pressing, yielded to their weight.
It gave way; and, with a cry, Gastineau and Fritz went
over, falling with the crushing masonry sheer forty feet
on to the flagstones which were set round the tower.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_318.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;Gastineau, with a great backward spring, reached a practical
firing distance.&#8221;</p>


<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span>With a swift sense of relief at his deliverance, Herriard,
trembling from the horror of the business, looked
over the edge of the tower. Below, where they had
fallen, layman and dog in their blood, and without sign
of life. Gastineau&#8217;s grey face, with eyes that, through
the mean disguise, seemed to glare up at him with a
vindictiveness that death could not kill, was the face
of a dead man. Herriard instinctively knew that. He
drew back, and went softly down the winding stairs of
the tower. On a table in the lower room lay his gun.
The cartridges had been extracted. He slipped others
in, and went outside.</p>

<p>The first thing he saw was his revolver which Gastineau
had made him throw away. He took it up, and
went on round the tower towards the place he dreaded.
There they lay; his enemy and his preserver; still, as
only they lie who will never move again. A glance now
sufficed to tell Herriard that his fears were at an end.</p>

<p>Nerving himself with the remembrance of his late
danger, he stooped and raised Gastineau&#8217;s head, the
head that had plotted such evil against him, and which
now lay twisted unnaturally away from his shoulders;
then he gently let it rest on the stones again. The dead
man&#8217;s neck was broken. Bar accidents, he had said;
and already, by a swift, dramatic stroke, the accident
had come. Fate had, in an instant, brushed away the
carefully spun web of the ambitious, relentless schemer.
With a sigh, and with a caressing touch for poor Fritz,
Herriard turned from the shattered abode of that master-spirit
who had been so strangely both friend and enemy
such as few men have owned; and took his way towards
home and Alexia, a free man.</p>

<hr class="tiny" />

<p>This romance of old Quebec is full of human interest.
Its events have to do with a stirring and intensely dramatic
episode never before touched upon by any novelist, the
Patriot War, or Struggle of French Canada for Independence
in 1837-38.</p>

<p>The story tells with dash and <i>verve</i> the fortunes and
loves of an ardent young volunteer, born under the British
flag, but educated in Paris, and by adoption a citizen of the
United States, and of his comrade, a European aristocrat
who had also joined the French Canadians. Two of the
best characters in the book are a noble English officer and
his sweetheart who rivals the heroine in the affections of
the reader.</p>

<p>The novel deals with mirth, adventure, and tragedy,
holding one&#8217;s interest by the author&#8217;s power of graphic
description. The pathos is lightened by humor, and the
love scenes are as charming as those of &#8220;A Daughter of
New France,&#8221; the first book which gave Miss Crowley a
high place among American novelists.</p>

<p>Written with unusual power by one of the few authors
capable of interpreting the inner life of the people of
Japan, &#8220;The Dragon Painter&#8221; holds the reader spellbound.</p>

<p>Kano Indara, the last of his race and the last of a
mighty line of artists, despairs of finding a true artist&mdash;a
Dragon Painter&mdash;to inherit his name and the traditions
of his race. An untamed mountain artist, Tatsu,
a painter of dragons, is sent to him. Kano shows him
his daughter, Um&egrave;-ko, and the youth looks upon her as
the Dragon Maid, for whom he has long been searching.
The story of their betrothal and the subsequent dramatic
events are all depicted with the same care of workmanship
and brilliant background that have characterized
this author&#8217;s previous books.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Dragon Painter&#8221; is a fresh, original, absorbing
story, wholly oriental in coloring, displaying a remarkable
acquaintance with Japanese life and character which
made &#8220;The Breath of the Gods&#8221; one of the notable novels
in current literature.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
